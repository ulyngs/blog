    "description": "Apple is deprecating traditional Safari Extensions in favor of 'Safari App Extensions' which have to be built using Xcode. However, I couldn't find any tutorials walking through a basic example of how to build extensions for Safari in this way, which made it slow and painful when I wanted to convert a simple extension for Facebook into a Safari App Extension. Here's a tutorial to help others in the same situation.",

To make it super easy in practice, I created two R packages which supply easy-to-use R Markdown templates in RStudio for CHI Proceedings and CHI Extended Abstracts.",

Yet an entire market has emerged for apps that remove functionality from laptops and smartphones, punish people for using Facebook when they shouldn’t, or provide easy ways to visualise how much they use their devices. Do the new anti-distraction tools actually change behaviour, and what could minimally-distracting design for always-connected devices look like?",

    "description": "For students who struggle with learning statistics, or for researchers who aren’t themselves statisticians, our obscure vocabulary makes understanding and remembering concepts unnecessarily difficult. It increases the number of terms to learn and puts a smokescreen over the relationship between tests. Reforming our statistics vocabulary should make statistics quicker to learn, more transparent to understand, and easier to use.",

    "description": "Science is in trouble. We find ourselves with a mess of publications in which true findings are scattered among false positives. An unacceptably wide range of claims can be made to seem legitimate by cherrypicking the literature. We urgently need a transparent metric for the level of confidence to have in specific findings - we urgently need a 'Reproducibility Index'.",

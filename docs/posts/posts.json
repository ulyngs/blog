To make it super easy in practice, I created two R packages which supply easy-to-use R Markdown templates in RStudio for CHI Proceedings and CHI Extended Abstracts.",

I cracked it in the end (I think). Here's a tutorial explaining how to write CHI articles in R Markdown using ACM's new article template.",

    "description": "Tech companies compete to make devices that do more faster, and with less effort. Yet an entire market has emerged for apps that remove functionality from laptops and smartphones, punish people for using Facebook when they shouldn’t, or provide easy ways to visualise how much they use their devices. Do the new anti-distraction tools actually change behaviour, and what could minimally-distracting design for always-connected devices look like?",

    "description": "For students who struggle with learning statistics, or for researchers who aren’t themselves statisticians, our obscure vocabulary makes understanding and remembering concepts unnecessarily difficult. It increases the number of terms to learn and puts a smokescreen over the relationship between tests. Reforming our statistics vocabulary should make statistics quicker to learn, more transparent to understand, and easier to use.",

    "description": "Science is in trouble. We find ourselves with a mess of publications in which true findings are scattered among false positives. An unacceptably wide range of claims can be made to seem legitimate by cherrypicking the literature. We urgently need a transparent metric for the level of confidence to have in specific findings - we urgently need a 'Reproducibility Index'.",

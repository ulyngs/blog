  abstract =      {Despite the abundance of research on social
                   networking sites, relatively little research has
                   studied those who choose not to use such sites. This
                   paper presents results from a questionnaire of over
                   400 Internet users, focusing specifically on Facebook
                   and those users who have left the service. Results
                   show the lack of a clear, binary distinction between
                   use and non-use, that various practices enable
                   diverse ways and degrees of engagement with and
                   disengagement from Facebook. Furthermore, qualitative
                   analysis reveals numerous complex and interrelated
                   motivations and justifications, both for leaving and
                   for maintaining some type of connection. These
                   motivations include: privacy, data misuse,
                   productivity, banality, addiction, and external
                   pressures. These results not only contribute to our
                   understanding of online sociality by examining this
                   under-explored area, but they also build on previous
                   work to help advance how we conceptually account for
                   the sociological processes of non-use.},

                   technology devices, which we term
                   “technoference,” will likely occur. We examine
                   the frequency of technoference in romantic
                   relationships and whether these everyday
                   interruptions relate to women's personal and
                   relational well-being. Participants were 143
                   married/cohabiting women who completed an online
                   questionnaire. The majority perceived that technology
                   devices (such as computers, cell or smartphones, or
                   TV) frequently interrupted their interactions, such
                   as couple leisure time, conversations, and mealtimes,
                   with their partners. Overall, participants who rated
                   more technoference in their relationships also
                   reported more conflict over technology use, lower
                   relationship satisfaction, more depressive symptoms,
                   and lower life satisfaction. We tested a structural
                   equation model of technoference predicting conflict
                   over technology use, which then predicted
                   relationship satisfaction, which finally predicted
                   depression and life satisfaction. By allowing
                   technology to interfere with or interrupt
                   conversations, activities, and time with romantic
                   partners—even when unintentional or for brief
                   moments—individuals may be sending implicit
                   messages about what they value most, leading to
                   conflict and negative outcomes in personal life and

                   part of people's lives, yet little research has
                   investigated attitudes about unplugging, also known
                   as media refusal. In this large-scale lifespan study
                   we surveyed 446 participants ages 14–79 about their
                   feelings and attitudes toward unplugging from CMC for
                   24 h. We also probed their actual recent experiences
                   of unplugging. We were particularly interested in age
                   differences. As predicted, younger people reported
                   more negative feelings about unplugging, and people
                   who reported higher scores on a loneliness survey
                   also expressed more negative feelings. However,
                   contrary to our hypothesis, there were no significant
                   age differences in the length of time participants
                   typically spent unplugged. Open-ended responses
                   revealed that participants felt a mix of emotions
                   about unplugging from CMC and were ambivalent about
                   its use for connection; “connecting with family and
                   friends” was listed as both a loss and a gain of
                   unplugging. In addition, prior experience unplugging
                   predicted less anxiety about a future anticipated
                   unplugging experience. We discuss age-related themes
                   that emerged about costs and benefits to unplugging,
                   anticipated unplugging activities, reasons for
                   unplugging, and the inherent complexity of retreating
                   from the web of digital technology and its pull of
                   readily available community, connection, and

                   attentional resources must be shared between tasks.
                   However, mobile phones generate auditory or tactile
                   notifications to alert users of incoming calls and
                   messages. Although these notifications are generally
                   short in duration, they can prompt task-irrelevant
                   thoughts, or mind wandering, which has been shown to
                   damage task performance. We found that cellular phone
                   notifications alone significantly disrupted

                   contexts. However, most of the research to date has
                   focused on understanding, analyzing and designing for
                   external interruptions. The causes of
                   self-interruptions are not well understood. In this
                   paper we present an analysis of 889 hours of observed
                   task switching behavior from 36 individuals across
                   three high-technology information work organizations.
                   Our analysis suggests that self-interruption is a
                   function of organizational environment and individual
                   differences, but also external interruptions
                   experienced. We find that people in open office
                   environments interrupt themselves at a higher rate.
                   We also find that people are significantly more
                   likely to interrupt themselves to return to solitary
                   work associated with central working spheres,
                   suggesting that self-interruption occurs largely as a

  abstract =      {Social media use is widespread, but many people worry
                   about overuse. This paper explores how and why people
                   take breaks from social media. Using a mixed methods
                   approach, we pair data from users who tweeted about
                   giving up Twitter for Lent with an interview study of
                   social media users. We find that 64{\%} of users who
                   proclaim that they are giving up Twitter for Lent
                   successfully do so. Among those who fail, 31{\%}
                   acknowledge their failure; the other 69{\%} simply
                   return. We observe hedging patterns (e.g. “I
                   thought about giving up Twitter for Lent
                   but{\ldots}”) that surfaced uncertainty about
                   social media behavior. Interview participants were
                   concerned about the tradeoffs of spending time on
                   social media versus doing other things and of
                   spending time on social media rather than in “real
                   life.” We discuss gaps in related theory that might
                   help reduce users' anxieties and open design problems
                   related to designing systems and services that can
                   help users manage their own social media use.},

  abstract =      {This paper discusses three concepts that govern
                   technosocial practices among university students with
                   iPhones. First is the social expectation of constant
                   connection that requires multitasking to achieve.
                   Second is the resulting technosocial pecking order of
                   who gets interrupted or ignored for whom. Third is
                   the way that many students push back against these
                   demands with techno-resistance, deliberately
                   curtailing constant connection to reduce the negative
                   effects of multitasking, in spite of the risk of
                   social censure. These concepts are developed from
                   interviews with 57 students, 30 hours of field
                   observations, and a survey of 177 students on
                   Stanford campus, which in particular explored iPhone
                   use. This research concludes that so-called "digital
                   natives" must still navigate familiar social dynamics
                   and personal desires, both online and off. Providing
                   a detailed description of how students from across
                   campus make sense of iPhones in their everyday
                   technosocial assemblages, this research suggests
                   opportunities for more socially and cognitively
                   sensitive design of smartphone features.},

                   active abstainers of the Facebook social network
                   site. I analyze the discourses invoked by individuals
                   who consciously choose to abstain from participation
                   on the ubiquitous Facebook platform. This discourse
                   analysis draws from approximately 100 web and print
                   publications from 2006 to early 2012, as well as
                   personal interviews conducted with 20 Facebook
                   abstainers. I conceptualize Facebook abstention as a
                   performative mode of resistance, which must be
                   understood within the context of a neoliberal
                   consumer culture, in which subjects are empowered to
                   act through consumption choices – or in this case
                   non-consumption choices – and through the public
                   display of those choices. I argue that such public
                   displays are always at risk of misinterpretation due
                   to the dominant discursive frameworks through which
                   abstention is given meaning. This paper gives
                   particular attention to the ways in which
                   connotations of taste and distinction are invoked by
                   refusers through their conspicuous displays of
                   non-consumption. This has the effect of framing
                   refusal as a performance of elitism, which may work
                   against observers interpreting conscientious refusal
                   as a persuasive and emulable practice of critique.
                   The implication of this is that refusal is a limited
                   tactic of political engagement where media platforms
                   are concerned.},

  abstract =      {The negative aspects of smartphone overuse on young
                   adults, such as sleep deprivation and attention
                   deficits, are being increasingly recognized recently.
                   This emerging issue mo- tivated us to analyze the
                   usage patterns related to smartphone overuse. We
                   investigate smartphone usage for 95 college stu-
                   dents using surveys, logged data, and interviews. We
                   first divide the participants into risk and non-risk
                   groups based on self-reported rating scale for
                   smartphone overuse. We then analyze the usage data to
                   identify between-group usage dif- ferences, which
                   ranged from the overall usage patterns to app-
                   specific usage patterns. Compared with the non-risk
                   group, our results show that the risk group has
                   longer usage time per day and different diurnal usage
                   patterns. Also, the risk group users are more
                   susceptible to push notifications, and tend to
                   consume more online content. We characterize the
                   overall relationship between usage features and
                   smartphone overuse using analytic modeling and
                   provide detailed illustrations of problematic usage

  abstract =      {Our preliminary study reveals that individuals use
                   various management strategies for limiting smartphone
                   use, ranging from keeping smartphones out of reach to
                   removing apps. However, we also found that users
                   often had difficulties in maintaining their chosen
                   management strategies due to lack of self-regulation.
                   In this paper, we present NUGU, a group- based
                   intervention app for improving self-regulation of
                   limit- ing smartphone use through leveraging social
                   support: groups of people limit their use together by
                   sharing their limiting information. NUGU is designed
                   based on social cognitive theory, and it has been
                   developed iteratively through two pi- lot tests. Our
                   three-week user study (n = 62) demonstrated that
                   compared with its non-social counterpart, the NUGU
                   users' usage amount significantly decreased and their
                   per- ceived level of managing disturbances improved.
                   Further- more, our exit interview confirmed that
                   NUGU's design el- ements are effective for achieving
                   limiting goals. Author},

                   paper, we present Lock n' LoL. This is an application
                   designed to help users focus on their group
                   activities by allowing group members to limit their
                   smartphone usage together. In particular, it provides
                   synchronous social awareness of each other's limiting
                   behavior. This synchronous social awareness can
                   arouse feelings of connectedness among group members
                   and can mitigate social vulnerability due to
                   smartphone distraction (e.g., social exclusion) that
                   often results in poor social experiences. After
                   following an iterative prototyping process, we
                   conducted a large-scale user study (n = 976) via real

                   blockers are one solution toward preventing unwanted
                   distractions. We conducted an in situ field study
                   with 32 information workers in their workplace to
                   test if the use of blocking software can increase
                   focus and productivity by preventing non-work-related

                   revealed individual differences in self-control in
                   managing distractions. Resultant changes in work
                   behaviors included switching from online distractions
                   to physical breaks of leaving the office. An
                   unexpected consequence of cutting off distractions
                   for people with less self-control was that they were
                   more focused and worked longer without taking breaks
                   and therefore, experienced higher stress. We present
                   design recommendations to promote focus for the
                   variety of coping behaviors we observed.},

  abstract =      {Design frictions, a term found in popular media
                   articles about user experience design, refer to
                   points of difficulty occurring during interaction
                   with technology. Such articles often argue that these
                   frictions should be removed from interaction flows in
                   order to reduce the risk of user frustration and
                   disengagement. In this paper we argue that, in many
                   scenarios, designing friction into interactions
                   through the introduction of microboundaries, can, in
                   fact, have positive effects. Design frictions can
                   disrupt “mindless” automatic interactions,
                   prompting moments of reflection and more
                   “mindful” interaction. The potential advantages
                   of intentionally introduced frictions are numerous:
                   from reducing the likelihood of errors in data-entry
                   tasks, to supporting health-behaviour change.},

                   health problem since the launch of the first
                   smartphone 10 years ago. In this article, pathways to
                   problematic use of smartphones, approaches to deal
                   with this issue and their limitations are discussed.
                   This includes problematic use of smartphones by
                   people who self-identify that they or their family
                   members use mobile devices in a problematic way.
                   Extreme problematic use (e.g. relating to online
                   gambling or heavy gaming) that severely disrupts
                   people's lives is a form of digital addiction is
                   excluded from this discussion. Smartphone use can be
                   problematic for some people due to the availability
                   of constant connection, the addictiveness of
                   applications (apps) combined with personal
                   psychological factors. This is facilitated by
                   characteristics of the technology, including easy
                   access, the possibility of escaping daily life, being
                   able to remain anonymous online, and the frequency of
                   alerts and messages. While various non-technical
                   interventions, such as digital detoxes, and digital
                   interventions, including apps to limit use, have been
                   developed to help people control their smartphone
                   use, none of these has proven to work yet. An
                   overview of currently available apps for problematic
                   smartphone use is provided. Further work is needed on
                   various aspects of problematic smartphone use,
                   including the understanding of how smartphone use
                   impacts on people's lives, strengthen- ing the
                   definition of problematic smartphone use, and
                   validation of its measurement, and more rigorous
                   development and assessment of tools. We hope that
                   these efforts will help people to use their
                   smartphones in a healthy and effective way.},

                   many distractions. As a result, seemingly
                   unproductive activities such as social networking
                   sites (SNS) cause considerable stress. This paper
                   reports a series of studies into whether personal
                   informatics (PI) tools for productivity can make
                   people more aware of their SNS usage and encourage
                   behaviour change. The first two studies took an
                   in-the-wild approach, encouraging students to use a
                   PI tool, RescueTime, to improve their estimations of
                   how much time they spent using SNS, in line with
                   research that had used this technique to reduce
                   However, participants simply did not engage with
                   RescueTime in the studies. A further interview study
                   found that there are four barriers that inhibit
                   engagement with this PI tool and reduce its potential
                   to facilitate behaviour change. In particular, the
                   way it presents data lacks: salience; contextual
                   information; credibility; and action advice.
                   INTRODUCTION The ubiquity of modern technologies has
                   revolutionised how people complete daily tasks.
                   Individuals are more reliant on computers than ever
                   before, and while this has made a number of
                   activities easier and quicker, it has also increased
                   the opportunities for interruption. Not only can
                   individuals be actively notified of incoming
                   information in the form of e-mails and instant
                   messages, but they also have easy access to a number
                   of other sources of distraction. While in some
                   workplaces, internet access may be restricted or
                   monitored, thus removing the temptation to access
                   distractions such as social networking sites (SNS),
                   this is not the case for students. Like knowledge
                   workers, their productivity relies heavily on their
                   own time management and therefore distractions by
                   anything deemed to be unproductive may be especially
                   stressful.},

                   finite resource that determines capacity for
                   effortful control over dominant responses and, once
                   expended, leads to impaired self-control task
                   performance, known as ego depletion. A meta-analysis
                   of 83 studies tested the effect of ego depletion on
                   task performance and related outcomes, alternative
                   explanations and moderators of the effect, and
                   additional strength model hypotheses. Results
                   revealed a significant effect of ego depletion on
                   self-control task performance. Significant effect
                   sizes were found for ego depletion on effort,
                   perceived difficulty, negative affect, subjective
                   fatigue, and blood glucose levels. Small,
                   nonsignificant effects were found for positive affect
                   and self-efficacy. Moderator analyses indicated
                   minimal variation in the effect across sphere of
                   depleting and dependent task, frequently used
                   depleting and dependent tasks, presentation of tasks
                   as single or separate experiments, type of dependent
                   measure and control condition task, and source
                   laboratory. The effect size was moderated by
                   depleting task duration, task presentation by the
                   same or different experimenters, intertask interim
                   period, dependent task complexity, and use of
                   dependent tasks in the choice and volition and
                   cognitive spheres. Motivational incentives, training
                   on self-control tasks, and glucose supplementation
                   promoted better self-control in ego-depleted samples.
                   Expecting further acts of self-control exacerbated
                   the effect. Findings provide preliminary support for
                   the ego-depletion effect and strength model
                   hypotheses. Support for motivation and fatigue as
                   alternative explanations for ego depletion indicate a
                   need to integrate the strength model with other
                   theories. Findings provide impetus for future
                   investigation testing additional hypotheses and
                   mechanisms of the ego-depletion effect.},

  abstract =      {Research on cognitive control and executive function
                   has long recognized the relevance of motivational
                   factors. Recently, however, the topic has come
                   increasingly to center stage, with a surge of new
                   studies examining the in-terface of motivation and
                   cognitive control. In the present article we survey
                   research situated at this interface, considering work
                   from cognitive and social psychology and behavioral
                   economics, but with a particular focus on
                   neuro-science research. We organize existing findings
                   into three core areas, consid-ering them in the light
                   of currently vying theoretical perspectives. Based on
                   the accumulated evidence, we advocate for a view of
                   control function that treats it as a domain of
                   reward-based decision making. More broadly, we argue
                   that neuroscientific evidence plays a critical role
                   in understanding the mechanisms by which motivation
                   and cognitive control interact. Opportu-nities for
                   further cross-fertilization between behavioral and
                   neuroscientific research are highlighted.},

  abstract =      {Self-control is often conceived as a battle between
                   “hot” impulsive processes and “cold”
                   deliberative ones. Heeding the angel on one shoulder
                   leads to success; following the demon on the other
                   leads to failure. Self-control feels like a duality.
                   What if that sensation is misleading, and despite how
                   they feel, self-control decisions are just like any
                   other choice? We argue that self-control is a form of
                   value-based choice wherein options are assigned a
                   subjective value and a decision is made through a
                   dynamic integration process. We articulate how a
                   value-based choice model of self-control can capture
                   its phenomenology and account for relevant behavioral
                   and neuroscientific data. This conceptualization of
                   self-control links divergent scientific approaches,
                   allows for more robust and precise hypothesis
                   testing, and suggests novel pathways to improve
                   self-control.},

  abstract =      {As the proverbial creatures of habit, people tend to
                   repeat the same behaviors in recurring contexts. This
                   review characterizes habits in terms of their cog-
                   nitive, motivational, and neurobiological properties.
                   In so doing, we identify three ways that habits
                   interface with deliberate goal pursuit: First, habits
                   form as people pursue goals by repeating the same
                   responses in a given con- text. Second, as outlined
                   in computational models, habits and deliberate goal
                   pursuit guide actions synergistically, although
                   habits are the efficient, default mode of response.
                   Third, people tend to infer from the frequency of
                   habit performance that the behavior must have been
                   intended. We conclude by applying insights from habit
                   research to understand stress and addiction as well
                   as the design of effective interventions to change
                   health and consumer behaviors.},

  abstract =      {Objectives: To review the fast-growing literature on
                   Internet addiction. Methods: Descriptive review,
                   using electronic databases as well as hand-search of
                   relevant publications or cross-references from 1970
                   to 2010. Results: There are no universally accepted
                   definitions for the captioned condition, but
                   investigators seem to agree that it involves
                   problematic computer usage that is time-consuming and
                   causes distress or impairs functioning in important
                   life domains. Several aetiological models have been
                   proposed, from the diverse perspectives of learning
                   theory, cognitive behavioural theory, social
                   learning, reward deficiency, culture, genetics and
                   neurobiology. Controversies abound, ranging from
                   conceptual (whether behavioural addictions are true
                   addictions), technical (which component of Internet
                   use is a person 'addicted' to), and practical (how
                   should Internet addiction be diagnosed, if it exists
                   at all). However, using various instruments and
                   populations, Internet addiction has been suggested as
                   having a prevalence of 0.3 to 38{\%}, with a young
                   male preponderance. Several screening, diagnostic,
                   and severity assessment instruments are now
                   available, but few have been subjected to rigorous
                   psychometric testing. Psychiatric co-morbidity is
                   common. Treatment modalities lack a firm evidence
                   base, but antidepressants, mood stabilisers, and
                   cognitive behavioural therapy and other
                   psychotherapies have been used. Conclusions:
                   Recently, the American Psychiatric Association
                   recommended including Internet addiction in its
                   forthcoming 5th edition of the Diagnostic and
                   Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, but only as
                   an appendix and not in the main body of the addictive
                   disorders. This appears to be a fairly balanced and
                   cautious approach, which can hopefully give rise to
                   more meaningful research in this important but
                   controversial area.},

  abstract =      {Anecdotal reports indicated that some on-line users
                   were becoming addicted to the Internet in much the
                   same way that others became addicted to drugs or
                   alcohol, which resulted in academic, social, and
                   occupational impairment. However, research among
                   sociologists, psychologists, or psychiatrists has not
                   formally identified addictive use of the Internet as
                   a problematic behavior. This study investigated the
                   existence of Internet addiction and the extent of
                   problems caused by such potential misuse. Of all the
                   diagnoses referenced in the Diagnostic and
                   Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth
                   Edition (DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association,
                   1995), Pathological Gambling was viewed as most akin
                   to the pathological nature of Internet use. By using
                   Pathological Gambling as a model, addictive Internet
                   use can be defined as an impulse-control disorder
                   that does not involve an intoxicant. Therefore, this
                   study developed a brief eight-item questionnaire
                   referred to as a Diagnostic Questionnaire (DQ), which
                   modified criteria for pathological gambling to
                   provide a screening instrument for classification of
                   participants. On the basis of this criteria, case
                   studies of 396 dependent Internet users (Dependents)
                   and 100 nondependent Internet users (Nondependents)
                   were classified. Qualitative analyses suggest
                   significant behavioral and functional usage
                   differences between the two groups such as the types
                   of applications utilized, the degree of difficulty
                   controlling weekly usage, and the severity of
                   problems noted. Clinical and social implications of
                   pathological Internet use and future directions for
                   research are discussed.},

                   the potential risks of problematic Facebook use for
                   mental health and well-being. The current
                   meta-analysis is the first to examine the
                   associations between problematic Facebook use,
                   psychological distress (i.e., depression, anxiety,
                   etc.) and well-being (life satisfaction, positive
                   mental health) among adolescents and young adults.
                   Method: A comprehensive search strategy identified
                   relevant studies in PsychInfo, Pubmed, Scopus,
                   ResearchGate, and Google Scholar. Results The final
                   sample included 23 independent samples with a total
                   of 13,929 participants (60.7{\%} females; Mage=
                   21.93, range: 16.5–32.4). Results of random effects
                   meta-analysis confirmed a positive correlation
                   between problematic Facebook use and psychological
                   distress (r =.34, 95{\%} CI [.28,.39]). Moderation
                   analysis revealed that effect sizes were larger in
                   older samples. Moreover, a negative correlation
                   between problematic Facebook use and well-being was
                   observed (r = −.22, 95{\%} CI [−.28, −.15]).
                   Limitations All available studies used a
                   cross-sectional design thus hampering the possibility
                   to establish the direction of the association between
                   problematic Facebook use and psychological distress
                   and well-being. Conclusions Results are discussed
                   within the extant literature on problematic Facebook
                   use and future research directions are proposed. This
                   research may also inform clinical and prevention

                   increasing interest in the conceptualization of
                   problematic Facebook use, and its associations with
                   individual characteristics. The present meta-analysis
                   aimed to summarize the findings of the recent
                   literature on this topic with the aim of
                   understanding the specific features of this
                   phenomenon (that is, its associations with the time
                   spent online and the broader concept of Internet
                   addiction), and the individual characteristics of
                   Facebook users (including gender differences,
                   personality traits, self-esteem levels, and
                   motivations for using Facebook). The sample included
                   56 independent samples with a total of 27,867
                   participants (59.22{\%} females; mean age = 23.94
                   years (SD = 4.75). Briefly, results showed a small
                   gender effect favoring females and a positive
                   association between problematic Facebook use, time
                   spent online and Internet addiction, whereas a
                   negative association was found with self-esteem.
                   Neuroticism and conscientiousness were the most
                   clearly personality traits associated with
                   problematic Facebook use, and the strongest
                   associations observed between problematic Facebook
                   use and motives with internal source and motives with
                   negative valence. This comprehensive meta-analysis
                   makes contributions to understanding the phenomenon
                   of problematic Facebook use and its relation with
                   individual characteristics.},

  abstract =      {Background and aims: Recent research suggests that
                   use of social networking sites can be addictive for
                   some individ-uals. Due to the link between
                   motivations for media use and the development of
                   addiction, this systematic review ex-amines
                   Facebook-related uses and gratifications research and
                   Facebook addiction research. Method: Searches of
                   three large academic databases revealed 24 studies
                   examining the uses and gratifications of Facebook,
                   and nine stud-ies of Facebook addiction. Results:
                   Comparison of uses and gratifications research
                   reveals that the most popular mo-tives for Facebook
                   use are relationship maintenance, passing time,
                   entertainment, and companionship. These moti-vations
                   may be related to Facebook addiction through use that
                   is habitual, excessive, or motivated by a desire for
                   mood alteration. Examination of Facebook addiction
                   research indicates that Facebook use can become
                   habitual or excessive, and some addicts use the site
                   to escape from negative moods. However, examination
                   of Facebook addic-tion measures highlights
                   inconsistency in the field. Discussion: There is some
                   evidence to support the argument that uses and
                   gratifications of Facebook are linked with Facebook
                   addiction. Furthermore, it appears as if the social
                   skill model of addiction may explain Facebook
                   addiction, but inconsistency in the measurement of
                   this condition limits the ability to provide
                   conclusive arguments. Conclusions: This paper
                   recommends that further research be performed to
                   establish the links between uses and gratifications
                   and Facebook addiction. Furthermore, in order to
                   enhance the construct validity of Facebook addiction,
                   researchers should take a more systematic approach to
                   assessment.},

                   technological behaviors” has substantially
                   increased. Research has also demonstrated strong
                   associations between addictive use of technology and
                   comorbid psychiatric disorders. In the present study,
                   23,533 adults (mean age 35.8 years, ranging from 16
                   to 88 years) participated in an online
                   cross-sectional survey examining whether demographic
                   variables, symptoms of
                   attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),
                   obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), anxiety, and
                   depression could explain variance in addictive use
                   (i.e., compulsive and excessive use associated with
                   negative outcomes) of two types of modern online
                   technologies: social media and video games.
                   Correlations between symptoms of addictive technology
                   use and mental disorder symptoms were all positive
                   and significant, including the weak interrelationship
                   between the two addictive technological behaviors.
                   Age appeared to be inversely related to the addictive
                   use of these technologies. Being male was
                   significantly associated with addictive use of video
                   games, whereas being female was significantly
                   associated with addictive use of social media. Being
                   single was positively related to both addictive
                   social networking and video gaming. Hierarchical
                   regression analyses showed that demographic factors
                   explained between 11 and 12{\%} of the variance in
                   addictive technology use. The mental health variables
                   explained between 7 and 15{\%} of the variance. The
                   study significantly adds to our understanding of
                   mental health symptoms and their role in addictive
                   use of modern technology, and suggests that the
                   concept of Internet use disorder (i.e., “Internet

  abstract =      {Cellular telephone use has become extremely
                   widespread over the past several years. There has
                   been concern that current high levels of cell phone
                   use may be compared to a behavioral addiction.
                   However, this has yet to be thoroughly tested. This
                   area of research also lacks in determining what the
                   causes and consequences of consistent cell phone use
                   may be. The present study examined the prevalence of
                   characteristics of a cell phone addiction among a
                   university student population along with possible
                   predictors of high frequency use. Participants were a
                   total of 152 undergraduate students (n = 35 males and
                   n = 117 females). It was hypothesized that anxiety,
                   as measured using self-report questionnaires, would
                   increase upon having access to one's cell phone
                   limited for high frequency users. However, anxiety
                   only increased when participants had their cell phone
                   sitting in front of them and were instructed not to
                   use them. Predictors and variables hypothesized to be
                   related included social anxiety, social
                   connectedness, and addiction-proneness. Results
                   indicated that social anxiety and addiction-proneness
                   are significant predictors of frequent cell phone
                   use, but social connectedness has no significant
                   connection. This study provided insights into why
                   cell phones are sometimes used so compulsively, and
                   if frequency of cell phone use is becoming so high
                   that it is becoming a new behavioral addiction.},

                   about how they managed boundaries between different
                   areas of their life. Interviewees reported
                   maintaining flexible and permeable boundaries that
                   are not bounded physically or temporally. They used
                   both technological and non-technological strategies
                   to manage different life spheres. Interviewees saw
                   technology as a major source of boundary violations
                   but also as a boundary managing strategy that allowed
                   them to achieve better life balance. Based on these
                   findings, we propose design implications for tools to
                   better support the boundary management processes of
                   undergraduate students.  CCS Concepts: •

  abstract =      {Social media utilities have made it easier than ever
                   to know about the range of online or offline social
                   activities one could be engaging. On the upside,
                   these social resources provide a multitude of
                   opportunities for interaction; on the downside, they
                   often broadcast more options than can be pursued,
                   given practical restrictions and limited time. This
                   dual nature of social media has driven popular
                   interest in the concept of Fear of Missing Out -
                   popularly referred to as FoMO. Defined as a pervasive
                   apprehension that others might be having rewarding
                   experiences from which one is absent, FoMO is
                   characterized by the desire to stay continually
                   connected with what others are doing. The present
                   research presents three studies conducted to advance
                   an empirically based understanding of the fear of
                   missing out phenomenon. The first study collected a
                   diverse international sample of participants in order
                   to create a robust individual differences measure of
                   FoMO, the Fear of Missing Out scale (FoMOs); this
                   study is the first to operationalize the construct.
                   Study 2 recruited a nationally representative cohort
                   to investigate how demographic, motivational and
                   well-being factors relate to FoMO. Study 3 examined
                   the behavioral and emotional correlates of fear of
                   missing out in a sample of young adults. Implications
                   of the FoMOs measure and for the future study of FoMO
                   are discussed. {\textcopyright}2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

                   the design of devices and applications encourage or
                   discourage multitasking behavior? Given the ease and
                   seamlessness of switching between goal-oriented tasks
                   and distractions in a browser, and the propensity to
                   lose track of time, our design team focused on
                   increasing awareness of switching between browser
                   tabs, and on increasing awareness of how time is
                   spent within tabs. We designed a browser plug-in that
                   automatically categorized URLs as work or non-work,
                   altered tab color, size and placement, and added a
                   status bar that displayed the total amount of time
                   spent on a tab and overall in work/non-work mode. We
                   conducted a two-week field study to evaluate the
                   effects on browsing behavior. We found that modifying
                   the browser design influenced multitasking:

                   switched between tabs less frequently and spent more

  abstract =      {In this study, electroencephalography (EEG) was used
                   to examine the relationship between two leading
                   hypotheses of cognitive aging, the inhibitory deficit
                   and the processing speed hypothesis. We show that
                   older adults exhibit a selective deficit in
                   suppressing task-irrelevant information during visual
                   working memory encoding, but only in the early stages
                   of visual processing. Thus, the employment of
                   suppressive mechanisms are not abolished with aging
                   but rather delayed in time, revealing a decline in
                   processing speed that is selective for the inhibition
                   of irrelevant information. EEG spectral analysis of
                   signals from frontal regions suggests that this
                   results from excessive attention to distracting
                   information early in the time course of viewing
                   irrelevant stimuli. Subdividing the older population
                   based on working memory performance revealed that
                   impaired suppression of distracting information early
                   in the visual processing stream is associated with
                   poorer memory of task-relevant information. Thus,
                   these data reconcile two cognitive aging hypotheses
                   by revealing that an interaction of deficits in
                   inhibition and processing speed contributes to
                   age-related cognitive impairment.},

                   effects of cognitive load on duration judgments.
                   Cognitive load refers to information-processing
                   (attentional or working-memory) demands. Six types of
                   cognitive load were analyzed to resolve ongoing
                   controversies and to test current duration judgment
                   theories. Duration judgments depend on whether or not
                   participants are informed in advance that they are
                   needed: prospective paradigm (informed) versus
                   retrospective paradigm (not informed). With higher
                   cognitive load, the prospective duration judgment
                   ratio (subjective duration to objective duration)
                   decreases but the retrospective ratio increases.
                   Thus, the duration judgment ratio differs depending
                   on the paradigm and the specific type of cognitive
                   load. As assessed by the coefficient of variation,
                   relative variability of prospective, but not
                   retrospective, judgments increases with cognitive
                   load. The prospective findings support models
                   emphasizing attentional resources, especially
                   executive control. The retrospective findings support
                   models emphasizing memory changes. Alternative
                   theories do not fit with the meta-analytic findings
                   and are rejected},

  abstract =      {While the popularity of smartphones has given
                   enormous convenience to our lives, their pathological
                   use has created a new mental health concern among the
                   community. Hence, intensive research is being
                   conducted on the etiology and treatment of the
                   condition. However, the traditional clinical approach
                   based surveys and interviews has serious limitations:
                   health professionals cannot perform continual
                   assessment and intervention for the affected group
                   and the subjectivity of assessment is questionable.
                   To cope with these limitations, a comprehensive ICT
                   (Information and Communications Technology) system
                   called SAMS (Smartphone Addiction Management System)
                   is developed for objective assessment and
                   intervention. The SAMS system consists of an Android
                   smartphone application and a web application server.
                   The SAMS client monitors the user's application usage
                   together with GPS location and Internet access
                   location, and transmits the data to the SAMS server.
                   The SAMS server stores the usage data and performs
                   key statistical data analysis and usage intervention
                   according to the clinicians' decision. To verify the
                   reliability and efficacy of the developed system, a
                   comparison study with survey-based screening with the
                   K-SAS (Korean Smartphone Addiction Scale) as well as
                   self-field trials is performed. The comparison study
                   is done using usage data from 14 users who are 19 to
                   50 year old adults that left at least 1 week usage
                   logs and completed the survey questionnaires. The
                   field trial fully verified the accuracy of the time,
                   location, and Internet access information in the
                   usage measurement and the reliability of the system
                   operation over more than 2 weeks. The comparison
                   study showed that daily use count has a strong
                   correlation with K-SAS scores, whereas daily use
                   times do not strongly correlate for potentially
                   addicted users. The correlation coefficients of count
                   and times with total K-SAS score are CC = 0.62 and CC
                   =0.07, respectively, and the t-test analysis for the
                   contrast group of potential addicts and the values
                   for the non-addicts were p = 0.047 and p = 0.507,

                   significant role in aiding patients and their

                   this medium, however, has created a stir among the
                   mental health community by great discussion of
                   Internet addiction. Addictive use of the Internet is
                   a new phenomenon which many practitioners are unaware
                   of and subsequently unprepared to treat. Some

                   T he purpose of this chapter is to enable clinicians
                   to better detect and treat Internet addiction. The
                   chapter will first focus on the complications of
                   diagnosis of Internet addiction. Second, the negative
                   consequences of such Internet abuse are explored.

                   causing the onset of pathological Internet use are
                   discussed. Fourth, a number of recovery strategies

                   emergent disorder, implications for future practice

                   extensively motivated and regulated by the ongoing
                   exercise of self-influence. The major self-regulative
                   mechanism operates through three principal
                   subfunctions. These include self-monitoring of one's
                   behavior, its determinants, and its effects; judgment
                   of one's behavior in relation to personal standards
                   and environmental circumstances; and affective
                   self-reaction. Self-regulation also encompasses the
                   self-efficacy mechanism, which plays a central role
                   in the exercise of personal agency by its strong
                   impact on thought, affect, motivation, and action.
                   The same self-regulative system is involved in moral
                   conduct although compared to the achievement domain,
                   in the moral domain the evaluative standards are more
                   stable, the judgmental factors more varied and
                   complex, and the affective self-reactions more
                   intense. In the interactionist perspective of social
                   cognitive theory, social factors affect the operation
                   of the self-regulative system. {\textcopyright}

                   these probabilities are presented. Variations in the
                   presentation of the same information, in several
                   areas of care, are considered to determine their
                   influence upon health decisions of both doctors and
                   patients. Three health-related predicaments involving
                   varying levels of risk are presented either in a
                   positive or a negative frame and were given to 74
                   medical students who stated whether they would advise

                   influence was bounded by the level of risk and the

                   users can access the Internet, communicate, and
                   entertain themselves anywhere and anytime. However,
                   the negative aspects of smartphone overuse on young
                   adults are being increasingly recognized recently.
                   One such serious problematic usage is peering at
                   brightly lit screens in dark, which can cause sleep
                   loss and resultant health problems. In this paper, we

                   unhealthy habit by measuring the ambient light

                   questions about the demand for, and effectiveness of,
                   commitment. Several important distinctions emerge.
                   First, we distinguish between what we call hard and
                   soft commitments and identify how soft commitments,

                   in explaining empirical behavior and in designing
                   effective commitment devices. Second, we highlight
                   the importance of certain modeling assumptions in

                   and examine the laboratory and field evidence on the

                   conditioning experiments in the study of fundamental
                   processes of reinforcement. Contradictory results
                   from human and animal experiments have been
                   attributed to the complex social and verbal history
                   of the human subject. On these grounds, it has been
                   contended that procedures that mimic those
                   conventionally used with animal subjects represent a
                   “poor analytic preparation” for the explication
                   of reinforcement principles. In defending the use of
                   conventional operant methods for human research, we
                   make three points: (a) Historical variables play a
                   critical role in research on processes of
                   reinforcement, regardless of whether the subjects are
                   humans or animals. (b) Techniques are available for
                   detecting, analyzing, and counteracting such
                   historical and extra-experimental influences; these
                   include long-term observations, steady state designs,
                   and, when variables are not amenable to direct
                   control (e.g., age, gender, species), selection of
                   subjects with common characteristics. (c) Other forms
                   of evidence that might be used to validate
                   conditioning principles—applied behavior analysis
                   and behavioristic interpretation—have inherent
                   limitations and cannot substitute for experimental
                   analysis. We conclude that human operant conditioning
                   experiments are essential for the analysis of the
                   reinforcement process at the human level, but caution
                   that their value depends on the extent to which the
                   traditional methods of the experimental analysis of
                   behavior are properly applied.},

                   desirable. More importantly, it was shown in all
                   experiments that these errors of prediction were
                   self-erasing. Having (mis)- predicted a given
                   behavior, subjects were likely to have these
                   predictions confirmed in later behavior. The
                   interpretation of these effects is that prediction of
                   a behavioral sequence evokes a specific cognitive
                   representation of that sequence, which is accessed on
                   subsequent occasions. The results demonstrate the
                   strong effects on behavior of engaging in
                   prebehavioral cognitive work. Relationships to Ajzen
                   and Fishbein's notions of behavioral intentions and
                   Abelson's notion of scripts are spelled out. Since
                   people overpredict desirable behaviors and
                   subsequently act in accord with those predictions,
                   implications for effects of behavioral predictions on
                   moral behavior are also suggested. [ABSTRACT FROM

                   personality is an empirical generalization about the
                   covariation of personality traits, and proposes that
                   neither the model itself nor the body of research
                   findings with which it is associated constitutes a
                   theory of personality. The authors summarize and
                   elaborate on the Five-Factor Theory (FFT; R. R.
                   McCrae and P. T. Costa, 1996) of personality that
                   represents an effort to construct such a theory that
                   is consistent with current knowledge. FFT is a
                   contemporary version of trait theory, based on the
                   assumptions that people are knowable, rational,
                   variable, and proactive. FFT explains personality
                   functioning as the operation of a universal
                   personality system, with defined categories of
                   variables and classes of dynamic processes that
                   indicate the main causal pathways. The five
                   personality factors—Neuroticism, Extraversion,
                   Openness, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness—form
                   the nucleus of the system. FFT provides a framework
                   in which to understand the development and operation
                   of psychological mechanisms and the behavior and

                   systems called personal informatics is appearing that
                   help people collect and reflect on personal
                   information. However, there is no comprehensive list

                   systems, and no guidance for making these systems
                   more effective. To address this, we conducted surveys
                   and interviews with people who collect and reflect on
                   personal information. We derived a stage-based model
                   of personal informatics systems composed of five
                   stages (preparation, collection, integration,
                   reflection, and action) and identified barriers in
                   each of the stages. These stages have four essential
                   properties: barriers cascade to later stages; they
                   are iterative; they are user-driven and/or
                   system-driven; and they are uni-faceted or
                   multi-faceted. From these properties, we recommend
                   that personal informatics systems should 1) be
                   designed in a holistic manner across the stages; 2)
                   allow iteration between stages; 3) apply an
                   appropriate balance of automated technology and user
                   control within each stage to facilitate the user
                   experience; and 4) explore support for associating
                   multiple facets of people's lives to enrich the value
                   of systems.},

                   mental health. BITs offer promising opportunities to
                   expand psychological practice. However, to realize
                   the potential of BITs, psychologists must understand
                   both the possibilities and the limitations associated

                   review examples of the most cutting-edge BITs and
                   discuss features that differentiate BITs from

                   The purpose commonly envisioned for these systems is
                   that they provide users with actionable, data-driven
                   self-insight to help them change their behavioral
                   patterns for the better. Here, we review relevant
                   theory as well as empirical evidence for this
                   self-improvement hypothesis. From a corpus of 6,568,
                   only 24 studies met the selection criteria of being a
                   peer-reviewed empirical study reporting on
                   actionable, data-driven insights from PI data, using
                   a “clean” PI system with no other intervention
                   techniques (e.g., additional coaching) on a
                   nonclinical population. First results are
                   promising—many of the selected articles report

                   (DBCIs), highlighting the need and potential for
                   conceptual and methodologic advances. The papers are
                   the product of a process of international expert
                   con-sensus building, supported by the United
                   Kingdom's Medical Research Council, the U.S. NIH's
                   Office for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research,
                   and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. The papers
                   are aimed at a broad readership, including those who
                   develop, evaluate, use, and fund DBCIs for both
                   research and practical purposes. The aim is to
                   provide guidance as to: 1. how more effective and
                   cost-effective DCBIs can be developed, how they
                   should be assessed, and the scientific priorities
                   that must be addressed to advance research in this
                   field; 2. how DBCIs can be used to advance scientific
                   under-standing of human behavior and behavior change.
                   By way of background, in early 2014, an international
                   and multidisciplinary steering committee, led by
                   Profes-sor Susan Michie and Professor Jeremy Wyatt,
                   identified important topics for consideration and
                   then participants who were either current or emerging
                   leaders in their respective domains to address these
                   topics. This led to a wide consultation process,
                   involving an international group of experts in key
                   aspects of DBCI development, evaluation, and usage,
                   drawn from the disciplines of behavioral and social
                   science, medicine, public health, health services
                   research, computer science and engineer-ing, and
                   economics. Participants were invited to join writing
                   groups relating to each topic and to attend a 2-day
                   workshop held in London in September 2015. The
                   writing groups produced an initial draft of each
                   paper for presentation for in-depth discussion at the
                   workshop, and then revised the papers, informed by
                   the discussions of the 42 experts who attended the
                   workshop. The second paper in the series 1 was also
                   informed by a preceding 2-day international workshop
                   focused specifically on the use of modeling in DBCIs.
                   In this series of papers, the term " DBCI " is used
                   to refer to an intervention that employs digital
                   technology to promote and maintain health, through
                   primary or secondary prevention and management of
                   health pro-blems. The technologies used can include
                   not only the Internet (accessed by smartphone, PC, or
                   tablet) but also automated healthcare and
                   communication systems and an increasing array of
                   mobile, wearable, and environ-mental sensors as well
                   as emerging Internet of Things devices that can
                   provide intelligent monitoring and feedback as and
                   when needed (" Just-In-Time Adaptive Interventions "
                   or " Ecological Momentary Interven-tions "). DBCIs
                   are typically automated, interactive, and
                   personalized, employing user input or sensor data to
                   tailor feedback or treatment pathways without the
                   need for health professional input, although they may
                   also involve elements of tele–health care
                   (digitally mediated remote monitoring by health
                   professionals) or direct interactions with human
                   facilitators. DBCIs can be used to promote health by
                   supporting behavior change or decision making
                   (whether of the general public, patients, or
                   healthcare practitioners), improving communication,
                   facilitating efficient and effective treatment, or
                   enhancing physical and mental well-being. The first
                   of the five main papers 2 provides a broad-ranging
                   reflection on how advances in technology, new
                   findings about the determinants of health and

                   systems are largely based in behavior change goals.
                   They do not adequately characterize the integration
                   of self-tracking into everyday life by people with
                   varying goals. We build upon prior work by embracing
                   the perspective of lived informatics to propose a new
                   model of personal informatics. We examine how lived
                   informatics manifests in the habits of self-trackers
                   across a variety of domains, first by surveying 105,
                   99, and 83 past and present trackers of physical
                   activity, finances, and location and then by
                   interviewing 22 trackers regarding their lived
                   informatics experiences. We develop a model
                   characterizing tracker processes of deciding to track
                   and selecting a tool, elaborate on tool usage during
                   collection, integration, and reflection as components
                   of tracking and acting, and discuss the lapsing and
                   potential resuming of tracking. We use our model to
                   surface underexplored challenges in lived
                   informatics, thus identifying future directions for
                   personal informatics design and research.},

                   such as the iPhone, mobile phones are being used in
                   novel ways to promote smoking cessation. Purpose:
                   This study set out to examine the content of the 47
                   iPhone applications (apps) for smoking cessation that
                   were distributed through the online iTunes store, as
                   of June 24, 2009. Methods: Each app was independently
                   coded by two reviewers for its (1) approach to
                   smoking cessation and (2) adherence to the U.S.
                   Public Health Service's 2008 Clinical Practice
                   Guidelines for Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence.
                   Each app was also coded for its (3) frequency of
                   downloads. Results: Apps identified for smoking
                   cessation were found to have low levels of adherence
                   to key guidelines in the index. Few, if any, apps
                   recommended or linked the user to proven treatments
                   such as pharmacotherapy, counseling, and/or a
                   quitline. Conclusions: iPhone apps for smoking
                   cessation rarely adhere to established guidelines for
                   smoking cessation. It is recommended that current
                   apps be revised and future apps be developed around
                   evidence-based practices for smoking cessation. ??

                   cessation smartphone apps available, downloaded an
                   estimated 780,000 times per month. No prior studies
                   have examined how individuals engage with specific
                   features of cessation apps and whether use of these
                   features is associated with quitting. Objectives:
                   Using data from a pilot trial of a novel smoking
                   cessation app, we examined: (i) the 10 most-used app
                   features, and (ii) prospective associations between
                   feature usage and quitting. Methods: Participants
                   (n=76) were from the experimental arm of a
                   randomized, controlled pilot trial of an app for
                   smoking cessation called "SmartQuit," which includes
                   elements of both Acceptance and Commitment Therapy
                   (ACT) and traditional cognitive behavioral therapy
                   (CBT). Utilization data were automatically tracked
                   during the 8-week treatment phase. Thirty-day point
                   prevalence smoking abstinence was assessed at 60-day
                   follow-up. Results: The most-used features-quit plan,
                   tracking, progress, and sharing-were mostly CBT. Only
                   two of the 10 most-used features were prospectively
                   associated with quitting: viewing the quit plan
                   (p=0.03) and tracking practice of letting urges pass
                   (p=0.03). Tracking ACT skill practice was used by
                   fewer participants (n=43) but was associated with
                   cessation (p=0.01). Conclusions: In this exploratory
                   analysis without control for multiple comparisons,
                   viewing a quit plan (CBT) as well as tracking
                   practice of letting urges pass (ACT) were both
                   appealing to app users and associated with successful
                   quitting. Aside from these features, there was little
                   overlap between a feature's popularity and its
                   prospective association with quitting. Tests of
                   causal associations between feature usage and smoking
                   cessation are now needed.},

  abstract =      {BACKGROUND: Rapid developments in technology have
                   encouraged the use of smartphones in health promotion
                   research and practice. Although many applications
                   (apps) relating to diet and nutrition are available
                   from major smartphone platforms, relatively few have
                   been tested in research studies in order to determine
                   their effectiveness in promoting health. METHODS: In
                   this article, we summarize data on the use of
                   smartphone applications for promoting healthy diet
                   and nutrition based upon bibliographic searches in
                   PubMed and CINAHL with relevant search terms
                   pertaining to diet, nutrition, and weight loss
                   through August 2015. RESULTS: A total of 193 articles
                   were identified in the bibliographic searches. By
                   screening abstracts or full-text articles, a total of
                   three relevant qualitative studies and 9 randomized
                   controlled trials were identified. In qualitative
                   studies, participants preferred applications that
                   were quick and easy to administer, and those that
                   increase awareness of food intake and weight
                   management. In randomized trials, the use of
                   smartphone apps was associated with better dietary
                   compliance for lower calorie, low fat, and high fiber
                   foods, and higher physical activity levels
                   (p=0.01-0.02) which resulted in more weight loss
                   (p=0.042-{\textless}0.0001). DISCUSSION: Future
                   studies should utilize randomized controlled trial
                   research designs, larger sample sizes, and longer
                   study periods to better establish the diet and
                   nutrition intervention capabilities of smartphones.
                   There is a need for culturally appropriate, tailored
                   health messages to increase knowledge and awareness
                   of health behaviors such as healthy eating.
                   Smartphone apps are likely to be a useful and
                   low-cost intervention for improving diet and
                   nutrition and addressing obesity in the general
                   population. Participants prefer applications that are
                   quick and easy to administer and those that increase
                   awareness of food intake and weight management.},

                   Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the

                   more likely to adopt smartphone dietapps if they are
                   perceived to be useful and enjoyable. Social norms
                   appear to play a significant role in adopting
                   smartphone apps. Individuals with higher personal
                   innovativeness tend to use such apps more often.
                   Study results can assist restaurant operators in
                   developing specific marketing strategies to target
                   particular segments by designing such diet apps and
                   developing menus for niche segments. This is one of
                   the first studies looking at whether smartphone apps
                   can assist individuals in ordering healthier and

  abstract =      {Automated coaching systems offer a convenient,
                   costeffective way to reduce stress, which can be a
                   serious health issue. However, one concern with such
                   systems is compliance; users fail to achieve daily
                   stress reduction goals because goals are too easy or
                   too difficult. To address this, we built DStress
                   (Design for Stress), a theoretically grounded system
                   that sets adaptive goals in three coaching
                   dimensions: Exercise, Meditation and Accessibility.
                   DStress modifies goal-difficulty based on the
                   individual's immediately previous performance. In a
                   28-day deployment with 65 users, DStress reduced
                   scores on one direct measure of stress almost in
                   half, significantly more than two other non-adaptive
                   coaching strategies. However, on a second direct
                   stress measure, no improvement was found. There were
                   also no improvements on other indirect stress
                   measures. Analysis of 2842 user-generated reports
                   suggests our findings were the result of DStress
                   balancing compliance against the degree of challenge
                   of the goals it would set.},

  abstract =      {Life is becoming increasingly stressful in many
                   aspects, e.g., due to technology-induced stress and
                   stress in organizational context. The assessment of
                   stress experienced by individuals enables stress
                   management and prevention with the long-term aim to
                   avoid psychological and physiological harm from
                   excessive stress. Commonly this assessment is
                   performed through questionnaires on perceived stress
                   or physiological measurements evaluating body
                   reactions to stress. We explore a third assess- ment
                   method: Our design science approach aims to
                   unobtrusively assess perceived stress based on
                   smartphone data while waiving additional devices and
                   explicit user input. The presented design arte- fact,
                   myStress, reads 36 hardware and software sensors to
                   infer users' perceived stress levels. A pro-
                   totypical instantiation of myStress for the Android
                   platform is distributed to test users. For evaluation
                   purposes, the stress level additionally is determined
                   by a questionnaire consisting of the Perceived Stress
                   Scale. By analyzing data from test users, we gain
                   first insights into the feasibility of unobtru- sive,
                   continuous stress assessment considering exclusively
                   data from smartphone sensors. We find that several
                   sensors seem to correlate with perceived stress,
                   e.g., the frequency of switching the display on/off.

  abstract =      {INTRODUCTION: Long-term health management is
                   challenging for the rapidly growing number of
                   patients with chronic diseases. Smartphone
                   interventions offer promising solutions. This article
                   presents features of smartphone interventions for
                   long-term chronic condition management, illustrating
                   how these applications benefit patients with chronic
                   diseases., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Systematic searches
                   for smartphone health interventions were conducted in
                   five publication databases. Articles were included
                   only if (1) the smartphone application (app) was
                   exclusively developed for patients with chronic
                   diseases and (2) the article incorporated a defined
                   outcome measurement to evaluate the effects of the
                   implemented intervention. Sixteen articles were
                   included in the final review, including studies in
                   diabetes, mental health problems, overweight, cancer,
                   and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease., RESULTS:
                   These studies found that the smartphone intervention
                   was a completely or at least partially effective tool
                   to assist in managing some chronic diseases. With the
                   help of health-related smartphone apps, patients with
                   chronic conditions (1) felt secure in the knowledge
                   that their illnesses were closely monitored, (2)
                   participated in their own health management more
                   effectively, and (3) felt that they had not been
                   forgotten by their doctors and were taken good care
                   of even outside the hospital/clinic., CONCLUSIONS:
                   However, there are limited smartphone apps for the
                   long-term health management of chronic diseases. More
                   smartphone apps need to be developed to help people
                   manage chronic diseases.},

                   research on self-ini-tiated and professionally
                   facilitated change of addictive behaviors using the
                   key transtheoretical constructs of stages and
                   processes of change. Modification of addictive
                   behaviors involves progression through five
                   stages—pre-contemplation, contemplation,
                   preparation, action, and maintenance—and
                   individuals typically recycle through these stages
                   several times before termination of the ad-diction.
                   Multiple studies provide strong support for these
                   stages as well as for a finite and common set of
                   change processes used to progress through the stages.
                   Research to date supports a transtheoretical model of
                   change that systematically integrates the stages with
                   processes of change from diverse theories of

                   conformity or nonconformity using a scrambled
                   sentences task and later placed into a conformity
                   situation. As predicted, participants primed with

                   participants primed with nonconformity. To

                   tended to conform more than those in the other two
                   groups, but the nonconformity primes did not induce
                   participants to rebel against the group norm.

                   of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1985, 1987) is reviewed,
                   and some unresolved issues are discussed. In broad
                   terms, the theory is found to be well supported by
                   empirical evidence. Intentions to perform behaviors
                   of different kinds can be predicted with high
                   accuracy from attitudes toward the behavior,
                   subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control;
                   and these intentions, together with perceptions of
                   behavioral control, account for considerable variance
                   in actual behavior. Attitudes, subjective norms, and
                   perceived behavioral control are shown to be related
                   to appropriate sets of salient behavioral, normative,
                   and control beliefs about the behavior, but the exact
                   nature of these relations is still uncertain.
                   Expectancy-value formulations are found to be only
                   partly successful in dealing with these relations.
                   Optimal rescaling of expectancy and value measures is
                   offered as a means of dealing with measurement
                   limitations. Finally, inclusion of past behavior in
                   the prediction equation is shown to provide a means
                   of testing the theory's sufficiency, another issue
                   that remains unresolved. The limited available
                   evidence concerning this question shows that the
                   theory is predicting behavior quite well in
                   comparison to the ceiling imposed by behavioral
                   reliability. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

  abstract =      {BACKGROUND: The Internet is increasingly used as a
                   medium for the delivery of interventions designed to
                   promote health behavior change. However, reviews of
                   these interventions to date have not systematically
                   identified intervention characteristics and linked
                   these to effectiveness. OBJECTIVES: The present
                   review sought to capitalize on recently published
                   coding frames for assessing use of theory and
                   behavior change techniques to investigate which
                   characteristics of Internet-based interventions best
                   promote health behavior change. In addition, we
                   wanted to develop a novel coding scheme for assessing
                   mode of delivery in Internet-based interventions and
                   also to link different modes to effect sizes.
                   METHODS: We conducted a computerized search of the
                   databases indexed by ISI Web of Knowledge (including
                   BIOSIS Previews and Medline) between 2000 and 2008.
                   Studies were included if (1) the primary components
                   of the intervention were delivered via the Internet,
                   (2) participants were randomly assigned to
                   conditions, and (3) a measure of behavior related to
                   health was taken after the intervention. RESULTS: We
                   found 85 studies that satisfied the inclusion
                   criteria, providing a total sample size of 43,236
                   participants. On average, interventions had a
                   statistically small but significant effect on
                   health-related behavior (d(+) = 0.16, 95{\%} CI 0.09
                   to 0.23). More extensive use of theory was associated
                   with increases in effect size (P = .049), and, in
                   particular, interventions based on the theory of
                   planned behavior tended to have substantial effects
                   on behavior (d(+) = 0.36, 95{\%} CI 0.15 to 0.56).
                   Interventions that incorporated more behavior change
                   techniques also tended to have larger effects
                   compared to interventions that incorporated fewer
                   techniques (P {\textless} .001). Finally, the
                   effectiveness of Internet-based interventions was
                   enhanced by the use of additional methods of
                   communicating with participants, especially the use
                   of short message service (SMS), or text, messages.
                   CONCLUSIONS: The review provides a framework for the
                   development of a science of Internet-based
                   interventions, and our findings provide a rationale
                   for investing in more intensive theory-based
                   interventions that incorporate multiple behavior
                   change techniques and modes of delivery.},

  abstract =      {Subliminal priming has the potential to influence
                   people's attitudes and behaviour, making them prefer
                   certain choices over others. Yet little research has
                   explored its feasibility on smartphones, even though
                   the global popularity and increasing use of
                   smartphones has spurred interest in mobile behaviour

                   ethical and design issues in delivering mobile
                   subliminal priming. We present three explorations of
                   the technique: a technical feasibility study, and two
                   participant studies. A pilot study (n=34) explored
                   subliminal goal priming in-the-wild over 1 week,
                   while a semi-controlled study (n=101) explored the

  abstract =      {Persuasive technologies aim to influence user's
                   behaviors. In order to be effective, many of the
                   persuasive technologies de-veloped so far relies on
                   user's motivation and ability, which is highly
                   variable and often the reason behind the failure of
                   such technology. In this paper, we present the
                   concept of Mindless Computing, which is a new
                   approach to persuasive technol-ogy design. Mindless
                   Computing leverages theories and con-cepts from
                   psychology and behavioral economics into the de-sign
                   of technologies for behavior change. We show through
                   a systematic review that most of the current
                   persuasive tech-nologies do not utilize the fast and
                   automatic mental pro-cesses for behavioral change and
                   there is an opportunity for persuasive technology
                   designers to develop systems that are less reliant on
                   user's motivation and ability. We describe two
                   examples of mindless technologies and present pilot
                   studies with encouraging results. Finally, we discuss
                   design guide-lines and considerations for developing
                   this type of persua-sive technology.},

                   allow people to override thoughts and emotions, thus
                   enabling behavior to vary adaptively from moment to
                   moment. Dominating contemporary research on this
                   topic is the viewpoint that self-control relies upon
                   a limited resource, such that engaging in acts of
                   restraint depletes this inner capacity and undermines
                   subsequent attempts at control (i.e., ego depletion).
                   Noting theoretical and empirical problems with this
                   view, here we advance a competing model that develops
                   a non-resource-based account of self-control. We
                   suggest that apparent regulatory failures reflect the
                   motivated switching of task priorities as people
                   strive to strike an optimal balance between engaging
                   cognitive labor to pursue 'have-to' goals versus

                   an overview and update of RP for addictive behaviors
                   with a focus on developments over the last decade
                   (2000-2010). Major treatment outcome studies and
                   meta-analyses are summarized, as are selected
                   empirical findings relevant to the tenets of the RP
                   model. Notable advances in RP in the last decade
                   include the introduction of a reformulated
                   cognitive-behavioral model of relapse, the
                   application of advanced statistical methods to model
                   relapse in large randomized trials, and the
                   development of mindfulness-based relapse prevention.
                   We also review the emergent literature on genetic
                   correlates of relapse following pharmacological and
                   behavioral treatments. The continued influence of RP
                   is evidenced by its integration in most
                   cognitive-behavioral substance use interventions.
                   However, the tendency to subsume RP within other
                   treatment modalities has posed a barrier to
                   systematic evaluation of the RP model. Overall, RP
                   remains an influential cognitive-behavioral framework

                   psychological and neuropsychological evidence, that
                   humans possess 2 memory systems. One system slowly
                   learns general regularities, whereas the other can
                   quicklyform representations ofunique or novel events.
                   Associative retrieval orpattern completion in the
                   slow-learning system elicited by a salient cue

                   ofexplicit, symbolically represented rulesfrom either
                   memory system and their use to guide processing.
                   After presenting our model, we review existing

                   their similar assumptions of a quick, effortless
                   processing mode that rests on well-learned prior
                   associations and a second, more effortful processing

                   experience from the non-routine goal-based system to
                   the routine system. At the same time it allows action

                   triggers and to biasing from multiple levels within

                   among 386 respondents. The results revealed that
                   habitual smartphone use is an important contributor
                   to addictive smartphone behavior. Process related
                   smartphone use is a strong determinant for both
                   developing habitual and addictive smartphone
                   behavior. People who extensively use their
                   smartphones for social purposes develop smartphone
                   habits faster, which in turn might lead to addictive
                   smartphone behavior. We did not find an influence of

                   smartphone behavior, while social stress positively
                   influences addictive smartphone behavior, and a
                   failure of self-regulation seems to cause a higher
                   risk of addictive smartphone behavior. Finally, men
                   experience less social stress than women, and use
                   their smartphones less for social purposes. The
                   result is that women have a higher chance in
                   developing habitual or addictive smartphone behavior.

                   processes (working memory, top-down sensitivity

                   this article, we provide a framework to better
                   understand how self-control can be improved. Using
                   cybernetic principles, we identify and integrate
                   important mechanisms for self-control improvement
                   that have previously been overlooked. The cybernetic
                   model suggests that control relies on three separate
                   processes: setting goals, monitoring when behavior
                   diverges from goals, and implementing behavior
                   aligned with goals. Within each of these stages, we
                   incorporate recent research identifying key features
                   of good self-control, including setting the “right
                   kind” of goals; the role of conflict detection,
                   attention, and emotional acceptance in goal
                   monitoring; and the effects of fatigue, shifting
                   priorities, and intentions on implementing behavioral
                   changes. Self-control is not easy, but by revealing
                   it as reliant on these diverse processes, we offer a
                   more comprehensive perspective on self-control, as
                   well as routes through which it can be improved.},

                   time scale of seconds is mediated by the persistent
                   discharges of neurons in a distributed brain network.
                   The representation of the spatial location of a
                   remembered visual stimulus has been studied most
                   extensively and provides the best-understood model of
                   how mnemonic information is encoded in the brain.
                   Neural correlates of spatial working memory are
                   manifested in multiple brain areas, including the
                   prefrontal and parietal association cortices. Spatial
                   working memory ability is severely compromised in
                   schizophrenia, a condition that has been linked to
                   prefrontal cortical malfunction. Recent computational
                   modeling work, in interplay with physiological
                   studies of behaving monkeys, has begun to identify
                   microcircuit properties and neural dynamics that are
                   sufficient to generate memory-related persistent
                   activity in a recurrent network of excitatory and
                   inhibitory neurons during spatial working memory.
                   This review summarizes recent results and discusses
                   issues of current debate. It is argued that
                   understanding collective neural dynamics in a
                   recurrent microcircuit provides a key step in
                   bridging the gap between network memory function and
                   its underlying cellular mechanisms. Progress in this
                   direction will shed fundamental insights into the
                   neural basis of spatial working memory impairment

                   that emphasize the bottom-up, image-based control of
                   attentional deployment. First, the perceptual
                   saliency of stimuli critically depends on the
                   surrounding context. Second, a unique 'saliency map'
                   that topographically encodes for stimulus conspicuity
                   over the visual scene has proved to be an efficient
                   and plausible bottom-up control strategy. Third,
                   inhibition of return, the process by which the
                   currently attended location is prevented from being
                   attended again, is a crucial element of attentional
                   deployment. Fourth, attention and eye movements
                   tightly interplay, posing computational challenges
                   with respect to the coordinate system used to control
                   attention. And last, scene understanding and object
                   recognition strongly constrain the selection of
                   attended locations. Insights from these five key
                   areas provide a framework for a computational and

                   such an opening statement does not make much sense
                   read in isolation, journalists often write headlines
                   like this on news websites. They use the
                   forward-referring technique as a stylistic and
                   narrative luring device trying to induce anticipation
                   and curiosity so the readers click (or tap on) the

                   of forward-referring headlines in online news
                   journalism by conducting an analysis of 100,000
                   headlines from 10 different Danish news websites. The
                   results show that commercialization and

                   identify the neural systems involved in
                   discriminating the shape, color, and speed of a
                   visual stimulus under conditions of selective and
                   divided attention. Psychophysical evidence indicated
                   that the sensitivity for discriminating subtle
                   stimulus changes in a same-different matching task
                   was higher when subjects selectively attended to one
                   attribute than when they divided attention among the
                   attributes. PET measurements of brain activity
                   indicated that modulations of extrastriate visual
                   activity were primarily produced by task conditions
                   of selective attention. Attention to speed activated
                   a region in the left inferior parietal lobule.
                   Attention to color activated a region in the
                   collateral sulcus and dorsolateral occipital cortex,
                   while attention to shape activated collateral sulcus
                   (similarly to color), fusiform and parahippocampal
                   gyri, and temporal cortex along the superior temporal
                   sulcus. Outside the visual system, selective and
                   divided attention activated nonoverlapping sets of
                   brain regions. Selective conditions activated globus
                   pallidus, caudate nucleus, lateral orbitofrontal
                   cortex, posterior thalamus/colliculus, and
                   insular-premotor regions, while the divided condition
                   activated the anterior cingulate and dorsolateral
                   prefrontal cortex. The results in the visual system
                   demonstrate that selective attention to different
                   features modulates activity in distinct regions of
                   extrastriate cortex that appear to be specialized for
                   processing the selected feature. The disjoint pattern
                   of activations in extravisual brain regions during
                   selective- and divided-attention conditions also
                   suggests that preceptual judgements involve different
                   neural systems, depending on attentional strategies.},

                   cortical neurons, both excitatory and inhibitory,
                   forming local and distant 'recurrent' networks.
                   Although this is a basic theme of cortical
                   organization, its study has been limited largely to
                   theoretical investigations, which predict that local
                   recurrent networks show a proportionality or balance
                   between recurrent excitation and inhibition, allowing
                   the generation of stable periods of activity1, 2, 3,
                   4, 5. This recurrent activity might underlie such
                   diverse operations as short-term memory4, 6, 7, the
                   modulation of neuronal excitability with attention8,
                   9, and the generation of spontaneous activity during
                   sleep5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Here we show that local
                   cortical circuits do indeed operate through a
                   proportional balance of excitation and inhibition
                   generated through local recurrent connections, and
                   that the operation of such circuits can generate
                   self-sustaining activity that can be turned on and
                   off by synaptic inputs. These results confirm the
                   long-hypothesized role of recurrent activity as a
                   basic operation of the cerebral cortex.},

                   declining a drink in order to drive home safely,
                   passing on the chocolate cake to stay on a diet, or
                   ignoring text messages to finish reading an important
                   paper. But enacting self-control is not always
                   difficult, particularly when it takes the form of
                   proactively choosing or changing situations in ways
                   that weaken undesirable impulses or potentiate
                   desirable ones. Examples of situational self-control
                   include the partygoer who chooses a seat far from
                   where drinks are being poured, the dieter who asks
                   the waiter not to bring around the dessert cart, and
                   the student who goes to the library without a cell
                   phone. Using the process model of self-control, we
                   argue that the full range of self-control strategies
                   can be organized by considering the timeline of the
                   developing tempting impulse. Because impulses tend to
                   grow stronger over time, situational self-control
                   strategies--which can nip a tempting impulse in the
                   bud--may be especially effective in preventing
                   undesirable action. Ironically, we may
                   underappreciate situational self-control for the same
                   reason it is so effective--namely, that by
                   manipulating our circumstances to advantage, we are
                   often able to minimize the in-the-moment experience
                   of intrapsychic struggle typically associated with
                   exercising self-control.},

                   immediate memory impose severe limitations on the
                   amount of information that we are able to receive,
                   process, and remember. By organizing the stimulus
                   input simultaneously into several dimensions and
                   successively into a sequence or chunks, we manage to
                   break (or at least stretch) this informational
                   bottleneck. Second, the process of recoding is a very
                   important one in human psychology and deserves much
                   more explicit attention than it has received. In
                   particular, the kind of linguistic recoding that
                   people do seems to me to be the very lifeblood of the
                   thought processes. Recoding procedures are a constant
                   concern to clinicians, social psychologists,
                   linguists, and anthropologists and yet, probably
                   because recoding is less accessible to experimental
                   manipulation than nonsense syllables or T mazes, the
                   traditional experimental psychologist has contributed
                   little or nothing to their analysis. Nevertheless,
                   experimental techniques can be used, methods of
                   recoding can be specified, behavioral indicants can
                   be found. And I anticipate that we will find a very
                   orderly set of relations describing what now seems an
                   uncharted wilderness of individual differences.
                   Third, the concepts and measures provided by the
                   theory of information provide a quantitative way of
                   getting at some of these questions. The theory
                   provides us with a yardstick for calibrating our
                   stimulus materials and for measuring the performance
                   of our subjects. In the interests of communication I
                   have suppressed the technical details of information
                   measurement and have tried to express the ideas in
                   more familiar terms; I hope this paraphrase will not
                   lead you to think they are not useful in research.
                   Informational concepts have already proved valuable
                   in the study of discrimination and of language; they
                   promise a great deal in the study of learning and
                   memory; and it has even been proposed that they can
                   be useful in the study of concept formation. A lot of
                   questions that seemed fruitless twenty or thirty
                   years ago may now be worth another look. In fact, I
                   feel that my story here must stop just as it begins
                   to get really interesting. And finally, what about
                   the magical number seven? What about the seven
                   wonders of the world, the seven seas, the seven
                   deadly sins, the seven daughters of Atlas in the
                   Pleiades, the seven ages of man, the seven levels of
                   hell, the seven primary colors, the seven notes of
                   the musical scale, and the seven days of the week?
                   What about the seven-point rating scale, the seven
                   categories for absolute judgment, the seven objects
                   in the span of attention, and the seven digits in the
                   span of immediate memory? For the present I propose
                   to withhold judgment. Perhaps there is something deep
                   and profound behind all these sevens, something just
                   calling out for us to discover it. But I suspect that
                   it is only a pernicious, Pythagorean coincidence.},

                   organization and integration of its key concepts
                   becomes increasingly important. In response, we
                   identified seven major components or “nodes” in
                   current theories and research bearing on
                   self-control: desire, higher order goal,
                   desire–goal conflict, control motivation, control
                   capacity, control effort, and enactment constraints.
                   To unify these diverse and interdisciplinary areas of
                   research, we formulated the interplay of these
                   components in an integrative model of self-control.
                   In this model, desire and an at least partly
                   incompatible higher order goal generate desire–goal
                   conflict, which activates control motivation. Control
                   motivation and control capacity interactively
                   determine potential control effort. The actual
                   control effort invested is determined by several
                   moderators, including desire strength, perceived
                   skill, and competing goals. Actual control effort and
                   desire strength compete to determine a prevailing
                   force, which ultimately determines behavior, provided
                   that enactment constraints do not impede it. The
                   proposed theoretical framework is useful for
                   highlighting several new directions for research on
                   self-control and for classifying self-control
                   failures and self-control interventions.},

  abstract =      {To deliver high-quality, reliable, and consistent
                   services safely, organizations develop professional
                   standards. Despite the communication and
                   reinforcement of these standards, they are often not
                   followed consistently. Although previous research
                   suggests that high job demands are associated with
                   declines in compliance over lengthy intervals, we
                   hypothesized-drawing on theoretical arguments focused
                   on fatigue and depletion-that the impact of job
                   demands on routine compliance with professional
                   standards might accumulate much more quickly. To test
                   this hypothesis, we studied a problem that represents
                   one of the most significant compliance challenges in
                   health care today: hand hygiene. Using longitudinal
                   field observations of over 4,157 caregivers working
                   in 35 different hospitals and experiencing more than
                   13.7 million hand hygiene opportunities, we found
                   that hand hygiene compliance rates dropped by a
                   regression-estimated 8.7 percentage points on average
                   from the beginning to the end of a typical 12-hr work
                   shift. This decline in compliance was magnified by
                   increased work intensity. Further, longer breaks
                   between work shifts increased subsequent compliance
                   rates, and such benefits were greater for individuals
                   when they had ended their preceding shift with a
                   lower compliance rate. In addition, (a) the decline
                   in compliance over the course of a work shift and (b)
                   the improvement in compliance following a longer
                   break increased as individuals accumulated more total
                   work hours the preceding week. The implications of
                   these findings for patient safety and job design are

                   treatment for alcohol problems. Drinking status and a
                   variety of predictor variables were measured every
                   two months for one year following presentation for
                   treatment. In addition to pretreatment
                   characteristics, potential antecedents of relapse
                   were assessed at each point within five domains: (1)
                   the occurrence of negative life events; (2) cognitive
                   appraisal variables including self-efficacy, alcohol
                   expectancies, and motivation for change; (3) client
                   coping resources; (4) craving experiences; and (5)
                   affective/mood status. Although the occurrence of
                   adverse life events did not predict 6-month relapse,
                   all other domains singly accounted for significant
                   variance in drinking outcomes. Proximal antecedents
                   (from the prior 2-month interval) significantly and
                   substantially improved predictive power over that
                   achieved from pretreatment characteristics alone.
                   When analyzed jointly, these predictors accounted for
                   a majority of variance in 6-month relapse status. A
                   prospective test supported Marlatt's developmental
                   model of relapse, pointing to two client factors as
                   optimally predictive of resumed drinking: lack of
                   coping skills and belief in the disease model of
                   alcoholism.},

  abstract =      {One important line of self-control research concerns
                   the phenomenon known as ego-depletion, the negative
                   effect of performing a self-control task (Task 1) on
                   performance on a subsequent self-control task (Task
                   2). Although a 2010 meta-analysis reported a moderate
                   effect size (d=.62) for this phenomenon (Hagger,
                   Wood, Stiff, {\&} Chatzisarantis, 2010), its
                   replicability has since come under scrutiny with the
                   publication of some replication failures (Lurquin et
                   al., 2016; Xu et al., 2014), including a high profile
                   study involving 23 laboratories (Hagger et al.,
                   2016). Some researchers even suggest that the
                   ego-depletion effect might not be real and that the
                   reported results primarily reflect publication bias
                   (Carter {\&} McCullough, 2014). This replication
                   crisis has prompted a call for additional replication
                   attempts involving large sample sizes and
                   preregistration (Carter, Kofler, Forster, {\&}
                   McCullough, 2015). Although such replication efforts
                   are undoubtedly important, we submit that, unless
                   some fundamental conceptual (and related
                   methodological) issues are more satisfactorily
                   addressed, attempts to evaluate the ego-depletion
                   effect would unlikely be successful. In this article,
                   we outline what we call the conceptual crisis for the
                   ego-depletion literature, explain how these
                   limitations undermine replication attempts, and
                   suggest possible ways to alleviate these Provisional
                   problems. We do so by noting some parallel problems
                   that have faced cognitive psychologists studying
                   attention, working memory (WM), and executive
                   functions (EFs), in the hope that such insights might
                   contribute to theoretical and empirical development
                   in ego-depletion research.},

                   on subsequent self-control tasks. We conducted four
                   studies (two with community samples, two with young
                   adult samples) utilizing a frequently used depletion
                   procedure (crossing out letters protocol) and the two

                   such as better health, cohesive personal
                   relationships, success in the workplace and at
                   school, and less susceptibility to crime and
                   addictions. In contrast, selfcontrol failure is
                   linked to maladaptive outcomes. Understanding the
                   mechanisms by which selfcontrol predicts behavior may
                   assist in promoting better regulation and outcomes. A
                   popular approach to understanding selfcontrol is the
                   strength or resource depletion model. Selfcontrol is
                   conceptualized as a limited resource that becomes
                   depleted after a period of exertion resulting in
                   selfcontrol failure. The model has typically been
                   tested using a sequentialtask experimental paradigm,
                   in which people completing an initial selfcontrol
                   task have reduced selfcontrol capacity and poorer
                   performance on a subsequent task, a state known as
                   ego depletion. Although a metaanalysis of
                   egodepletion experiments found a mediumsized effect,
                   subsequent metaanalyses have questioned the size and
                   existence of the effect and identified instances of
                   possible bias. The analyses served as a catalyst for
                   the current Registered Replication Report of the
                   egodepletion effect. Multiple laboratories (k = 23,
                   total N = 2,141) conducted replications of a
                   standardized egodepletion protocol based on a
                   sequentialtask paradigm by Sripada et al.
                   Metaanalysis of the studies revealed that the size of
                   the egodepletion effect was small with 95{\%}

                   emotions/cheerfulness facet of Extraversion were the
                   strongest and most consistent predictors of life
                   satisfaction. These two facets often accounted for
                   more variance in life satisfaction than Neuroticism
                   and Extraversion. The findings suggest that measures
                   of depression and positive emotions/cheerfulness are
                   necessary and sufficient to predict life satisfaction
                   from personality traits. The results also lead to a
                   more refined understanding of the specific
                   personality traits that influence life satisfaction:
                   Depression is more important than anxiety or anger
                   and a cheerful temperament is more important than
                   being active or sociable.},

                   containing drinks have been demonstrated to

                   when being ingested and when merely being sensed in
                   the oral cavity. However, since the underlying
                   evidence is less compelling than suggested,
                   replications are crucially required. In Experiment 1,
                   70 participants consumed a drink containing either
                   sugar or a non-caloric sweetener between two
                   administrations of delay-discounting tasks.
                   Experiment 2 (N=115) was designed to unravel the
                   psychological function of oral glucose sensing by
                   manipulating the temporal delay between a glucose
                   mouth rinse and the administration of the consecutive

                   to previous challenges of the glucose model of

                   well-being. However, people's capacity for
                   self-control is limited and becomes depleted through
                   use. One prominent explanation for this depletion
                   posits that self-control consumes energy through
                   carbohydrate metabolization, which further suggests
                   that ingesting carbohydrates improves self-control.
                   Some evidence has supported this energy model, but
                   because of its broad implications for efforts to
                   improve self-control, we reevaluated the role of
                   carbohydrates in self-control processes. In four
                   experiments, we found that (a) exerting self-control
                   did not increase carbohydrate metabolization, as
                   assessed with highly precise measurements of blood
                   glucose levels under carefully standardized
                   conditions; (b) rinsing one's mouth with, but not
                   ingesting, carbohydrate solutions immediately
                   bolstered self-control; and (c) carbohydrate rinsing
                   did not increase blood glucose. These findings
                   challenge metabolic explanations for the role of
                   carbohydrates in self-control depletion; we therefore
                   propose an alternative motivational model for these
                   and other previously observed effects of

  abstract =      {A growing number of studies have investigated how
                   motivation interacts with particular cognitive
                   functions, including attention, working memory, and
                   other executive functions. In these studies, the
                   emphasis has been on understanding how motivation
                   impacts brain regions that contribute to improving
                   behavioral performance. Less is understood about how
                   positive incentives may actually impair behavioral
                   performance. Here, we were interested in
                   investigating a situation in which reward would be
                   potentially deleterious to behavioral performance.
                   Specifically, we hypothesized that rewarding
                   participants for correct going would impair stopping
                   performance. Critically, we hypothesized that the
                   effects on inhibition would be specific, namely, not
                   simply attributable to a speeding-up of reaction time
                   during go trials. To investigate the interaction
                   between inhibition and motivation, participants
                   performed a stop-signal task during two conditions,
                   namely, during a neutral, control condition and
                   during a rewarded condition during which they were
                   rewarded for correct go performance. Behaviorally,
                   participants exhibited longer stop-signal reaction
                   times during the reward relative to the control
                   condition, indicating that it was harder to inhibit
                   their responses during the former condition.
                   Neuroimaging findings revealed that a host of brain
                   regions were involved in stop-signal inhibition, as
                   indexed via the contrast of successful and
                   unsuccessful stop trials. Critically, a subset of
                   these regions, which included the right inferior
                   frontal gyrus, the left precentral gyrus, and
                   bilateral putamen, exhibited significant inhibition
                   by condition interactions, demonstrating that
                   cognitive and motivational signals interact in the
                   brain during inhibitory control. ?? 2009 Elsevier

                   during challenging behavioral conditions? Here, we
                   investigated the interactions between motivation and
                   cognition during a response conflict task and tested
                   a specific model of the effect of reward on cognitive
                   processing. Behaviorally, participants exhibited
                   reduced conflict during the reward versus no-reward
                   condition. Brain imaging results revealed that a
                   group of subcortical and fronto-parietal regions was
                   robustly influenced by reward at cue processing and,
                   importantly, that cue-related responses in
                   fronto-parietal attentional regions were predictive
                   of reduced conflict-related signals in the medial pFC
                   (MPFC)/ACC during the upcoming target phase. Path
                   analysis revealed that the relationship between cue
                   responses in the right intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and
                   interference-related responses in the MPFC during the
                   subsequent target phase was mediated via signals in
                   the left fusiform gyrus, which we linked to
                   distractor-related processing. Finally, reward
                   increased functional connectivity between the right
                   IPS and both bilateral putamen and bilateral nucleus
                   accumbens during the cue phase, a relationship that
                   covaried with across-individual sensitivity to reward
                   in the case of the right nucleus accumbens. Taken
                   together, our findings are consistent with a model in
                   which motivationally salient cues are employed to
                   upregulate top-down control processes that bias the
                   selection of visual information, thereby leading to
                   more efficient stimulus processing during conflict

                   signaled high- or low-value reward for memorizing an
                   upcoming scene. When tested 24 hr postscan, subjects
                   were significantly more likely to remember scenes
                   that followed cues for high-value rather than
                   low-value reward. A monetary incentive delay task
                   independently localized regions responsive to reward
                   anticipation. In the encoding task, high-reward cues
                   preceding remembered but not forgotten scenes
                   activated the ventral tegmental area, nucleus
                   accumbens, and hippocampus. Across subjects, greater
                   activation in these regions predicted superior memory
                   performance. Within subject, increased correlation
                   between the hippocampus and ventral tegmental area
                   was associated with enhanced long-term memory for the

                   predict declarative memory formation. The findings
                   are consistent with the hypothesis that reward

  abstract =      {An important use of machine learning is to learn what
                   people value. What posts or photos should a user be
                   shown? Which jobs or activities would a person find
                   rewarding? In each case, observations of people's
                   past choices can inform our inferences about their
                   likes and preferences. If we assume that choices are
                   approxi-mately optimal according to some utility
                   function, we can treat preference inference as
                   Bayesian inverse plan-ning. That is, given a prior on
                   utility functions and some observed choices, we
                   invert an optimal decision-making process to infer a
                   posterior distribution on utility func-tions.
                   However, people often deviate from approximate
                   optimality. They have false beliefs, their planning
                   is sub-optimal, and their choices may be temporally
                   in-consistent due to hyperbolic discounting and other
                   bi-ases. We demonstrate how to incorporate these
                   devia-tions into algorithms for preference inference
                   by con-structing generative models of planning for
                   agents who are subject to false beliefs and time
                   inconsistency. We explore the inferences these models
                   make about pref-erences, beliefs, and biases. We
                   present a behavioral experiment in which human
                   subjects perform prefer-ence inference given the same
                   observations of choices as our model. Results show
                   that human subjects (like our model) explain choices
                   in terms of systematic de-viations from optimal
                   behavior and suggest that they take such deviations
                   into account when inferring pref-erences.},

  abstract =      {Previous research, involving monetary rewards, found
                   that limbic reward-related areas show greater
                   activity when an intertemporal choice includes an
                   immediate reward than when the options include only
                   delayed rewards. In contrast, the lateral prefrontal
                   and parietal cortex (areas commonly associated with
                   deliberative cognitive processes, including future
                   planning) respond to intertemporal choices in general
                   but do not exhibit sensitivity to immediacy (McClure
                   et al., 2004). The current experiments extend these
                   findings to primary rewards (fruit juice or water)
                   and time delays of minutes instead of weeks. Thirsty
                   subjects choose between small volumes of drinks
                   delivered at precise times during the experiment
                   (e.g., 2 ml now vs 3 ml in 5 min). Consistent with
                   previous findings, limbic activation was greater for
                   choices between an immediate reward and a delayed
                   reward than for choices between two delayed rewards,
                   whereas the lateral prefrontal cortex and posterior
                   parietal cortex responded similarly whether choices
                   were between an immediate and a delayed reward or
                   between two delayed rewards. Moreover, relative
                   activation of the two sets of brain regions predicts
                   actual choice behavior. A second experiment finds
                   that when the delivery of all rewards is offset by 10
                   min (so that the earliest available juice reward in
                   any choice is 10 min), no differential activity is
                   observed in limbic reward-related areas for choices
                   involving the earliest versus only more delayed
                   rewards. We discuss implications of this finding for
                   differences between primary and secondary rewards.},

                   problems. We develop a model where a person chooses

  abstract =      {BACKGROUND: Depression is highly prevalent and causes
                   considerable suffering and disease burden despite the
                   existence of wide-ranging treatment options. Mobile
                   phone apps offer the potential to help close this
                   treatment gap by confronting key barriers to
                   accessing support for depression. OBJECTIVES: Our
                   goal was to identify and characterize the different
                   types of mobile phone depression apps available in
                   the marketplace. METHODS: A search for depression
                   apps was conducted on the app stores of the five
                   major mobile phone platforms: Android, iPhone,
                   BlackBerry, Nokia, and Windows. Apps were included if
                   they focused on depression and were available to
                   people who self-identify as having depression. Data
                   were extracted from the app descriptions found in the
                   app stores. RESULTS: Of the 1054 apps identified by
                   the search strategy, nearly one-quarter (23.0{\%},
                   243/1054) unique depression apps met the inclusion
                   criteria. Over one-quarter (27.7{\%}, 210/758) of the
                   excluded apps failed to mention depression in the
                   title or description. Two-thirds of the apps had as
                   their main purpose providing therapeutic treatment
                   (33.7{\%}, 82/243) or psychoeducation (32.1{\%},
                   78/243). The other main purpose categories were
                   medical assessment (16.9{\%}, 41/243), symptom
                   management (8.2{\%}, 20/243), and supportive
                   resources (1.6{\%}, 4/243). A majority of the apps
                   failed to sufficiently describe their organizational
                   affiliation (65.0{\%}, 158/243) and content source
                   (61.7{\%}, 150/243). There was a significant
                   relationship (chi(2) 5=50.5, P{\textless}.001)
                   between the main purpose of the app and the reporting
                   of content source, with most medical assessment apps
                   reporting their content source (80.5{\%}, 33/41). A
                   fifth of the apps featured an e-book (20.6{\%},
                   50/243), audio therapy (16.9{\%}, 41/243), or
                   screening (16.9{\%}, 41/243) function. Most apps had
                   a dynamic user interface (72.4{\%}, 176/243) and used
                   text as the main type of media (51.9{\%}, 126/243),
                   and over a third (14.4{\%}, 35/243) incorporated more
                   than one form of media. CONCLUSION: Without guidance,
                   finding an appropriate depression app may be
                   challenging, as the search results yielded
                   non-depression-specific apps to depression apps at a
                   3:1 ratio. Inadequate reporting of organization
                   affiliation and content source increases the
                   difficulty of assessing the credibility and
                   reliability of the app. While certification and
                   vetting initiatives are underway, this study
                   demonstrates the need for standardized reporting in
                   app stores to help consumers select appropriate
                   tools, particularly among those classified as medical
                   devices.},

  abstract =      {BACKGROUND Hundreds of mental health apps are
                   available to the general public. With increasing
                   pressures on health care systems, they offer a
                   potential way for people to support their mental
                   health and well-being. However, although many are
                   highly rated by users, few are evidence-based.
                   Equally, our understanding of what makes apps
                   engaging and valuable to users is limited. OBJECTIVE
                   The aim of this paper was to analyze functionality
                   and user opinions of mobile apps purporting to
                   support cognitive behavioral therapy for depression
                   and to explore key factors that have an impact on
                   user experience and support engagement. METHODS We
                   systematically identified apps described as being
                   based on cognitive behavioral therapy for depression.
                   We then conducted 2 studies. In the first, we
                   analyzed the therapeutic functionality of apps. This
                   corroborated existing work on apps' fidelity to
                   cognitive behavioral therapy theory, but we also
                   extended prior work by examining features designed to
                   support user engagement. Engagement features found in
                   cognitive behavioral therapy apps for depression were
                   compared with those found in a larger group of apps
                   that support mental well-being in a more general
                   sense. Our second study involved a more detailed
                   examination of user experience, through a thematic
                   analysis of publicly available user reviews of
                   cognitive behavioral therapy apps for depression.
                   RESULTS We identified 31 apps that purport to be
                   based on cognitive behavioral therapy for depression.
                   Functionality analysis (study 1) showed that they
                   offered an eclectic mix of features, including many
                   not based on cognitive behavioral therapy practice.
                   Cognitive behavioral therapy apps used less varied
                   engagement features compared with 253 other mental
                   well-being apps. The analysis of 1287 user reviews of
                   cognitive behavioral therapy apps for depression
                   (study 2) showed that apps are used in a wide range
                   of contexts, both replacing and augmenting therapy,
                   and allowing users to play an active role in
                   supporting their mental health and well-being. Users,
                   including health professionals, valued and used apps
                   that incorporated both core cognitive behavioral
                   therapy and non-cognitive behavioral therapy
                   elements, but concerns were also expressed regarding
                   the unsupervised use of apps. Positivity was seen as
                   important to engagement, for example, in the context
                   of automatic thoughts, users expressed a preference
                   to capture not just negative but also positive ones.
                   Privacy, security, and trust were crucial to the user
                   experience. CONCLUSIONS Cognitive behavioral therapy
                   apps for depression need to improve with respect to
                   incorporating evidence-based cognitive behavioral
                   therapy elements. Equally, a positive user experience
                   is dependent on other design factors, including
                   consideration of varying contexts of use. App
                   designers should be able to clearly identify the

  abstract =      {Background: Mobile phones have become nearly
                   ubiquitous, offering a promising means to deliver
                   health interventions. However, little is known about
                   smartphone applications (apps) for cancer. Objective:
                   The purpose of this study was to characterize the
                   purpose and content of cancer-focused smartphone apps
                   available for use by the general public and the
                   evidence on their utility or effectiveness. Methods:
                   We conducted a systematic review of the official
                   application stores for the four major smartphone
                   platforms: iPhone, Android, Nokia, and BlackBerry.
                   Apps were included in the review if they were focused
                   on cancer and available for use by the general
                   public. This was complemented by a systematic review
                   of literature from MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane
                   Library to identify evaluations of cancer-related
                   smartphone apps. Results: A total of 295 apps from
                   the smartphone app stores met the inclusion criteria.
                   The majority of apps targeted breast cancer
                   (46.8{\%}, 138/295) or cancer in general (28.5{\%},
                   84/295). The reported app purpose was predominantly
                   to raise awareness about cancer (32.2{\%}, 95/295) or
                   to provide educational information about cancer
                   (26.4{\%}, 78/295), followed by apps to support
                   fundraising efforts (12.9{\%}, 38/295), assist in
                   early detection (11.5{\%}, 34/295), promote a
                   charitable organization (10.2{\%}, 30/295), support
                   disease management (3.7{\%}, 11/295), cancer
                   prevention (2.0{\%}, 6/295), or social support
                   (1.0{\%}, 3/295). The majority of the apps did not
                   describe their organizational affiliation (64.1{\%},
                   189/295). Apps affiliated with non-profit
                   organizations were more likely to be free of cost
                   ({\$}\chi{\$}21=16.3, P{\textless}.001) and have a
                   fundraising or awareness purpose
                   ({\$}\chi{\$}22=13.3, P=.001). The review of the
                   health literature yielded 594 articles, none of which
                   reported an evaluation of a cancer-focused smartphone
                   application. Conclusions: There are hundreds of
                   cancer-focused apps with the potential to enhance
                   efforts to promote behavior change, to monitor a host
                   of symptoms and physiological indicators of disease,
                   and to provide real-time supportive interventions,
                   conveniently and at low cost. However, there is a
                   lack of evidence on their utility, effectiveness, and
                   safety. Future efforts should focus on improving and
                   consolidating the evidence base into a whitelist for
                   public consumption.},

  abstract =      {Holding a strong goal intention ("I intend to reach
                   Z!") does not guarantee goal achievement, because
                   people may fail to deal effectively with
                   self-regulatory problems during goal striving. This
                   review analyzes whether realization of goal
                   intentions is facilitated by forming an
                   implementation intention that spells out the when,
                   where, and how of goal striving in advance ("If
                   situation Y is encountered, then I will initiate
                   goal-directed behavior X!"). Findings from 94
                   independent tests showed that implementation
                   intentions had a positive effect of medium-to-large
                   magnitude (d = .65) on goal attainment.
                   Implementation intentions were effective in promoting
                   the initiation of goal striving, the shielding of
                   ongoing goal pursuit from unwanted influences,
                   disengagement from failing courses of action, and
                   conservation of capability for future goal striving.
                   There was also strong support for postulated
                   component processes: Implementation intention
                   formation both enhanced the accessibility of
                   specified opportunities and automated respective
                   goal-directed responses. Several directions for
                   future research are outlined. {\textcopyright} 2006

                   in changing behaviours in ways that enhance financial
                   capability. Traditionally, behavior change has been
                   seen through the lens of “changing minds”: if we
                   can change the way people think—their beliefs,
                   attitudes, and goals—then we can change the way
                   they behave. More recent developments in behavioral
                   theory show that “changing contexts” can have a
                   powerful effect on behavior: we can change behavior
                   by sometimes quite subtle changes to the environment
                   or context within which decisions are made. We focus
                   largely on the influence of context and provide
                   examples from current UK banks that have changed the
                   “choice architecture” of their products.},

  abstract =      {The distribution of videos over the Internet is
                   drastically transforming how media is consumed and
                   monetized. Content providers, such as media outlets
                   and video subscription services, would like to ensure
                   that their videos do not fail, start up quickly, and
                   play without interruptions. In return for their
                   investment in video stream quality, content providers
                   expect less viewer abandonment, more viewer
                   engagement, and a greater fraction of repeat viewers,
                   resulting in greater revenues. The key question for a
                   content provider or a content delivery network (CDN)
                   is whether and to what extent changes in video
                   quality can cause changes in viewer behavior. Our
                   work is the first to establish a causal relationship
                   between video quality and viewer behavior, taking a
                   step beyond purely correlational studies. To
                   establish causality, we use Quasi-Experimental
                   Designs, a novel technique adapted from the medical
                   and social sciences. We study the impact of video
                   stream quality on viewer behavior in a scientific
                   data-driven manner by using extensive traces from
                   Akamai's streaming network that include 23 million
                   views from 6.7 million unique viewers. We show that
                   viewers start to abandon a video if it takes more
                   than 2 s to start up, with each incremental delay of
                   1 s resulting in a 5.8{\%} increase in the
                   abandonment rate. Furthermore, we show that a
                   moderate amount of interruptions can decrease the
                   average play time of a viewer by a significant
                   amount. A viewer who experiences a rebuffer delay
                   equal to 1{\%} of the video duration plays 5{\%} less
                   of the video in comparison to a similar viewer who
                   experienced no rebuffering. Finally, we show that a
                   viewer who experienced failure is 2.32{\%} less
                   likely to revisit the same site within a week than a
                   similar viewer who did not experience a failure.},

  year =          {2015},
  abstract =      {Pleasure is mediated by well-developed
                   mesocorticolimbic circuitry and serves adaptive
                   functions. In affective disorders, anhedonia (lack of
                   pleasure) or dysphoria (negative affect) can result
                   from breakdowns of that hedonic system. Human
                   neuroimaging studies indicate that surprisingly
                   similar circuitry is activated by quite diverse
                   pleasures, suggesting a common neural currency shared
                   by all. Wanting for reward is generated by a large
                   and distributed brain system. Liking, or pleasure
                   itself, is generated by a smaller set of hedonic hot
                   spots within limbic circuitry. Those hot spots also
                   can be embedded in broader anatomical patterns of
                   valence organization, such as in a keyboard pattern
                   of nucleus accumbens generators for desire versus
                   dread. In contrast, some of the best known textbook
                   candidates for pleasure generators, including classic
                   pleasure electrodes and the mesolimbic dopamine
                   system, may not generate pleasure after all. These
                   emerging insights into brain pleasure mechanisms may
                   eventually facilitate better treatments for affective
                   disorders. How does pleasure arise in the brain?
                   Solving that puzzle is a major goal for affective
                   neuroscience. Berridge and Kringelbach assess what is
                   currently known about how brain limbic systems encode
                   and cause pleasure versus displeasure.},

  abstract =      {Theory provides a helpful basis for designing
                   interventions to change behaviour but offers little
                   guidance on how to do this. This paper aims to
                   illustrate methods for developing an extensive list
                   of behaviour change techniques (with definitions) and
                   for linking techniques to theoretical constructs. A
                   list of techniques and definitions was generated from
                   techniques published in two systematic reviews,
                   supplemented by “brainstorming” and a systematic
                   search of nine textbooks used in training applied
                   psychologists. Inter-rater reliability of extracting
                   the techniques and definitions from the textbooks was
                   assessed. Four experts judged which techniques would
                   be effective in changing 11 theoretical constructs
                   associated with behaviour change. Thirty-five
                   techniques identified in the reviews were extended to
                   53 by brainstorming and to 137 by consulting
                   textbooks. Agreement for the 53 definitions was 74.7
                   per cent (15.4{\%} cells completed and 59.3{\%} cells
                   empty for both raters). Agreement about the link
                   between the 35 techniques and theoretical constructs
                   was 71.7 per cent of 385 judgments (12.2{\%}
                   agreement that effective and 59.5{\%} agree- ment
                   that not effective). This preliminary work
                   demonstrates the possibility of developing a
                   comprehensive, reliable taxonomy of techniques linked
                   to theory. Further refinement is needed to eliminate
                   redundancies, resolve uncertainties, and complete
                   technique definitions.},

                   of behaviour change. However, the science of
                   intervention development remains at an early stage.
                   We present a causal modelling approach to developing
                   complex interventions for evaluation in randomized
                   trials. In this approach a generic model links
                   behavioural determinants, causally through behaviour,
                   to physiological and biochemical variables, and
                   health outcomes. It is tailored to context, target
                   population, behaviours and health outcomes. The
                   development of a specific causal model based on
                   theory and evidence is illustrated by the ProActive
                   programme, supporting increased physical activity
                   among individuals at risk of Type 2 diabetes. The
                   model provides a rational guide to appropriate
                   measures, intervention points and intervention
                   techniques, and can be tested quantitatively. Causal
                   modelling is critically compared to other approaches
                   to intervention development and evaluation, and

title: "How to Use Pandoc Filters for Advanced Customisation of Your R Markdown Documents"
description: |
  In a package I'm developing, I had a problem around highlighting text in LaTeX and HTML output. The solution I found involved using **pandoc filters** to take full control over the final document. Here's a guide to writing such filters when R Markdown ain't got what you need.

# The problem
I'm developing an R package called [`oxforddown`](https://github.com/ulyngs/oxforddown) to write my PhD thesis in R Markdown and format it with the time-tested [`OxThesis`](https://github.com/mcmanigle/OxThesis) LaTeX template used by many an Oxford grad student.

However, one feature of the OxThesis template just wouldn't play nicely with R Markdown: \
To highlight post-viva corrections, the template has a feature that lets you wrap inline corrections in the LaTeX command `\mccorrect{corrected text here}` and put longer blocks of corrections in the LaTeX environment `\begin{mccorrection} corrected long text here \end{correction}`. When doing so, these parts are given a blue background in the resulting PDF:

```{r corrections-in-oxthesis}
include_graphics("figures/inline.png")
include_graphics("figures/chunk.png")
```

This feature was difficult to get to work simultaneously for my intended outputs:
One of the main points of the `oxforddown` package is to let you compile your thesis to [PDF in the OxThesis template format](https://github.com/ulyngs/oxforddown/blob/master/docs/_main.pdf) *or* to [HTML in the 'gitbook' format](https://ulyngs.github.io/oxforddown/).

For entire chunks of corrections, it was relatively simple. 
I could use the syntax ```` ```{block type='correction'} ```` in the chunk options to create a [custom block](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/custom-blocks.html).
In PDF output, this would put the content between `\begin{mccorrection}` and `\end{mccorrection}`; in HTML output, the content would be wrapped in a div with class 'mccorrection', as in `<div class="correction"> my corrected long text here </div>`.

But for inline corrections, it was tricky:\
If I used raw LaTeX, it would break the HTML output.\
If I used raw HTML, it would break the PDF output.\

I experimented with building my own function to apply the appropriate environments to inline corrections, like `` ``r ''`r apply_correction{and *italicised* correction}` ``. 

But with this approach, markdown syntax wasn't rendered correctly: For example, italicised text would in PDF output be rendered literally as 'an \*italicised\* correction'.

*Sigh.*

# Finding a solution: The path from .Rmd to output
To solve the problem, I began by reminding myself how R Markdown works under the hood:

```{r, fig.cap="Flowchart of the route from .Rmd file to compiled document"}
include_graphics("https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/61d189fd9cdf955058415d3e1b28dd60e1bd7c9b/9791d/images/rmarkdownflow.png")
```

[`knitr`](https://yihui.name/knitr/) executes the code in your R markdown source file (**.Rmd**) and creates a markdown (**.md**) file that contains both your text and the rendered results of your code.
Then [`pandoc`](http://pandoc.org) converts this markdown file into your output format of choice, in my case an OxThesis-formatted PDF or a set of gitbook-formatted HTML files.

So instead of fiddling around at the **.Rmd** -> **.md** stage, as I tried at first, why not try at the **.md** -> **.pdf/.html** stage?
Turns out that's exactly what ['pandoc filters'](http://pandoc.org/filters.html) are for.

# What are pandoc filters?
`pandoc` is an open-source document converter written by [John MacFarlane](https://johnmacfarlane.net).
It converts documents from one format to another by parsing the source file into an 'abstract syntax tree' (AST) which is then converted into the target format.

A [pandoc filter](http://pandoc.org/filters.html) is a little program (potentially written in any programming language) that does some modification to the AST before the output is created:

```markdown
INPUT -> pandoc reader -> AST -> filter -> AST -> pandoc writer -> OUTPUT
```

## An Abstract Syntax Tr... What Now?
Imagine you have a simple document called **text.Rmd**:

```markdown
---
title: AST-what-now?
author: Ulrik Lyngs
---

## my header

Some text with *italics* and also **bold**.
```

When pandoc reads this, it splits it up into a `Meta` block containing the stuff in the YAML header (in this case title and author), and a list of `Block` elements containing the actual content (in this case two blocks, a '`Header`' and a '`Para`').

If you've got pandoc accessible at the terminal, you can see what this looks like by creating a file named **text.Rmd**, putting the content above into it, navigating to its location, and then typing in the command `pandoc -s -t native test.Rmd`:

```terminal
~ ulyngs$ pandoc -s -t native text.Rmd

Pandoc (Meta {unMeta = fromList [("author",MetaInlines [Str "Ulrik",
Space,Str "Lyngs"]),("title",MetaInlines [Str "AST-what?"])]})
[Header 2 ("my-header",[],[]) [Str "my",Space,Str "header"],
Para [Str "Some",Space,Str "text",Space,Str "with",Space,
Emph [Str "italics"],Space,Str "and",Space,Str "also",Space,
Strong [Str "bold"],Str "."]]
```

## Languages with which to write pandoc filters
So basically, a pandoc filter walks through our document's elements in this form and makes some changes we might want.

The original way to create filters used the functional programming language [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org).
However, as Haskell is not widely known, John MacFarlane also created the python package [`pandocfilters`](https://github.com/jgm/pandocfilters), and others made the more accessible alternative (still in python) [`panflute` package](https://github.com/sergiocorreia/panflute). Adaptations of the `pandocfilters` package have been developed for other languages, including [JavaScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pandoc-filter) and [R](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pandocfilters/README.html)).

A potential problem with these options is that they create new dependencies, for example on a local Python installation, which means that additional stuff besides `pandoc` is necessary to get them to work.

Since pandoc v2.0, [this problem can be bypassed](https://www.pandoc.org/lua-filters.html): Now, pandoc has a built-in ability to understand filters written in the lightweight programming language [lua](http://www.lua.org) (the pandoc executable now includes a lua interpreter and relevant libraries).

**tl;dr**: pandoc filters written in [lua](http://www.lua.org) should 'just work'. Yay, let's use lua!

# Taking lua filters for a spin
First thing to note is that Lua is a bit strange. 
It supports only a small number of atomic data types, and typical data structures like lists are represented using tables.
In fact, tables are Lua's only native data structure.

With that in mind (which will make sense of the syntax we use to solve the original problem in a minute), let's try a couple of examples.

## Manipulate Metadata from YAML header
Imagine we want to use a pandoc filter to change the author name in the final output of **text.Rmd**.

First, create an empty text file and save it with the name **toy_filter.lua**. Then, in **text.Rmd**'s YAML header, add an line that tells pandoc to use this file as a lua filter:

```markdown
---
title: AST-what-now?
author: Ulrik Lyngs
output:
  pdf_document:
    pandoc_args: ["--lua-filter=toy_filter.lua"]
---

## my header

Some text with *italics* and also **bold**.
```

If we leave **toy_filter.lua** empty and knit **text.Rmd**, the PDF output is unaltered:

```{r}
include_graphics("figures/lua-no.png")
```

Now let's use our **toy_filter.lua* as a filter to change the author name to 'Hello, World!'. 
The filter should find the YAML metadata in the abstract syntax tree (AST) and manipulate the author, before pandoc goes on to convert it to a **.tex** file from which a PDF can be built.

To do this, we create a function with the name of the element in the AST we want to manipulate, in this case `Meta`.
This function should manipulate the author and return a modified version:

```lua
function Meta(m)
  m.author = "Hello, World!"
  return m
end
```

If we save **toy_filter.lua** and now knit **text.Rmd** to PDF, this is the result:

```{r}
include_graphics("figures/lua-yes.png")
```

## Manipulate text formatting
Another silly example: Say we wanted to change *italicised text* to **bold**.

First, we look at the [documentation for pandoc lua filters](https://www.pandoc.org/lua-filters.html). We notice that italicised text passages are parsed by pandoc as `Emph` inline elements in the AST, and text passages in bold as `Strong` inline elements.

Then we add this to **toy_filter.lua**:

```lua
function Emph(element)
  return pandoc.Strong(element.content)
end
```

Now, when we save **toy_filter.lua** and knit **text.Rmd** to PDF, we get this:

```{r}
include_graphics("figures/lua-bold.png")
```

# Solving the original problem
My problem was how to do inline highlighting of text in both HTML and PDF output. 

In the OxThesis LaTeX template this was already possible by wrapping text in a `mccorrect` command `\mccorrect{like this}`. 

To solve the problem, I needed to use some inline element that pandoc could parse. 
Turns out pandoc recognises inline `span` elements. 

The solution was therefore quite simple:\
In my source document I could wrap inline-text passages I wanted to highlight in a `span` element, `<span>like this</span>`.
To avoid highlighting *all* span elements, I would also add a class 'correction', as in `<span class="correction">like this</span>`.

## Solving for HTML
When outputting to HTML, highlighting these passages was then simply a matter of styling with CSS: I created a new text file **style.css** and in it added

```css
.correction {
  background-color: #CCCCFF;
}
```


From a document like this...

```markdown
---
title: AST-what-now?
author: Ulrik Lyngs
output:
  html_document:
    css: style.css
  pdf_document:
    pandoc_args: ["--lua-filter=toy_filter.lua"]
---

## my header

Some text with *italics* and also **bold**.

And <span class="correction">this text</span>, but not this, 
<span class="correction">should be highlighted</span>.
```

I now got this when outputting to HTML:

```{r}
include_graphics("figures/solved-html.png")
```

## Solving for PDF
For PDF output, I needed the lua filter to find `Span` elements, check if the class was "correction", and if so wrap the content in the `\mccorrect` command. This would do the trick:

```lua
function Span (el)
  if el.classes[1] == "correction" then
    table.insert(el.content, 1, pandoc.RawInline('latex', '\\mccorrect{'))
    table.insert(el.content, pandoc.RawInline('latex', '}'))
    end
  return el.content
end
```

If I included this in **toy_filter.lua**, knitted **text.Rmd** to PDF and inspected the intermediary **.tex** file (add `keep_tex: true` in your YAML header) I saw that it worked as expected:

```latex
Some text with \textbf{italics} and also \textbf{bold}.

And \mccorrect{this text}, but not this, \mccorrect{should be
highlighted}.

\end{document}
```

<aside>
Note that unless you are using a LaTeX template which has a command `mccorrect` defined, you will get an error at the final step of creating a PDF from the **.tex** file.
</aside>


Hooray!

# Conclusion
It can be tricky to figure out how pandoc filters and the lua language work.

When you try making your own filters, you might want to start by playing around with print statements (in the filter above, I tried printing to the console the list of classes assigned to an element with `print(table.concat(el.classes,", "))`; I also tried printing out true/false as to whether the 'correction' class was indeed the first one with `print(el.classes[1] == "correction"))`; etc.).

And of course have a look at the example filters on [https://github.com/pandoc/lua-filters](github.com/pandoc/lua-filters) and look for examples that resemble what you need.

Good luck!
